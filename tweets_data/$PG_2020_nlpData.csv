Agreed. Too many stocks to think about; better to find your sweet spot and stick with it. I‚Äôll never be a value stock picker. I have no interest in $IBM $BAC $GE $XOM $PG etc. Those are not just boring companies but a waste of time to think about. I like the HIGH growth STOCKS.

Some of the stocks that has really benefitted has grown more than revenue growth, but that is resonable.

So I se that space as ok.

Absolute blowout earnings and a FY raise on August 4.  Basically been in a downtrend since.  $PG & $CL rallied since then while $CLX declined 10%.  I didn't read the conference call so don't know if anything was said.  Valuations about the same now, but $CLX fundamentals better.

I have no idea.

It isn't tech, because the rate of change of technology is too high and Bezos will retire before then.

It isn't medical, because it's too likely to be regulated. Same for energy.

It sure as hell isn't US banks.

Maybe $PG or $MMM.

One of my favorite ideas (if you're just starting out) is to walk around your house.  Buy what you use EVERY day.  

Your toothpaste:  $CHD, $PG
Your CL phone: $T, $VZ
Your car:  $F, $GM, $TM

Do research. If it's something you've been using your whole life its likely a good bet.

Great company of course, but $CHD has stellar EPS growth (compared to other staples) because they don't have to deal with foreign currency and retain more profits. 

80% sales come from US as opposed to $PG which is 40%

Def not worth 33x earnings. At least for me.

High yield dividends stocks I like:

Dividend growth stocks I like:

Safe dividends:
$JNJ $MMM $WM $KO $PG

Or if you‚Äôre not ready for individual stocks, invest in dividend ETF‚Äôs

$AAPL used to trade at a PE of 15 - arguably low. Now trades at a PE of 34, thanks to software services / recurring revs stream. Rerating reflects this expanded model.

$PG has a ratio of 26. I‚Äôd rather own $AAPL at 34. Not egregiously expensive, not with Fed funds rate at 0.25.

I guess I just don't put a lot of faith in these value indexes to actual capture value. I can't find the MS specific benchmark you're referencing, but using $VIVAX, $PG, $WMT and $NEE are among the top 20 holdings. $NEE is one of the most overvalued companies in the market.

$PG and $WMT are fantastic companies but in what world do they represent value. Probably warrants a deeper dive than I've done looking over it for a second but it's hard to draw too many conclusions when the index construction seems flawed.

$PG you can do the VWAP baton-hand-off and see that it may have found support around $135, with confluence of an area of historical support (three bounces).

It feels $134 may be the bottom, so not a bad place to buy in now, but no short float expect an upwards grind.

Not a fan.

If you look a bit deeper into the deal, it's not bad for Premier. $PG shareholders have exposure to a company severely undervalued and shareholders will own 70% of the spin-off of its Nevada assets through I-80 gold (McCoye Cover, South Arturo, and Getchell).
