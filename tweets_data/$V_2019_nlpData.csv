This will take a long time. Bank credit card issuance is extremely concentrated with $JPM $C $COF $BAC and $USB taking the lion share. It isn't hard to imagine them working around $V and $MA at least at the margins initially.

Really this is distributed ledger.
I think the big banks create their own payment system(s) which will look a lot like $V and $MA.

$V is no slouch either. Pretty similar Performance. It's just that it IPO'd  little later (March 2008) and as a bigger company. The gains they produced for the long term shareholders with such little volatility (except during GFC) is just admirable.

I can't think of a more bullish sign than what is happening with $v Visa. Clearly a well run company with a solid moat/amazing secular trends but it's also a proxy for the health of the consumer and spending in general. Going to guess a new ATH isn't bearish for equities.

I don't see this as a 'winner takes all' industry - its too big. Any big industry has two major players and both make out like bandits - $KO $PEP , $MA $V , $NKE Adidas etc.

So, both $LYFT and $UBER will probably succeed IMO. They are already too big. Time will tell.

Can't compare $V and $MA to $LYFT and $UBER. The first two get far more efficient with scale. I just don't see how the same can be said for Lyft and Uber. They may very well be good investments. I believe due to these factors and relatively lrg market cap there r better options.

Yep, the $V/$MA duopoly has done quite well for both investments over time, to the detriment of neither and possibly a symbiotic benefit to both

This is besides the point of the original thread, but I've always been curious about $V. ~35x earnings and once we become saturated it should grow at ~world GDP, say 5%. Should be high teens PE multiple at that point. I can't find the exact chart, but I believe about half...

Agree with growth on $V. In addition to growth, V could be perceived as a good store of value which keeps the PE high. Also, what does the interest environment look like. If low interest rates are the new normal for a long time, predictable cash flow companies claim higher value

Of all payments are either through debit, credit, or mobile wallet which runs through $V / $MA anyways. So it feels to me like all the expected growth might be amortized through a reduction in the PE multiple. Is that just way too simplistic?

Multiple companies can, and often do, succeed in the same space. See $MA and $V - I hold both. If it affects the ‘story’ of the company I’ll exit but management efficiencies (like price-hikes) can offset challenges. I’ll find out in a few reports but this is a swing pos so far

Revenue growing >20% per annum at this scale and growth has recently accelerated! Can't believe $GOOGL is selling at 24 times year-end PE. 

Even $MA and $V (with lower projected growth) are trading at 30 times year-end PE.

$SQ is one of the names that makes the least valuation sense to me. It gets a disruptor multiple, fine. But its business is moving closer and closer to lower margin areas. They will never have 50% profits of a $V or $MA

Looking at MS's model for both $V and $MA, they have operating margins peaking for $V in 2021 and $MA in 2020 and declining ~40-75bps/ year after that for $V and 4-10bps/year for $MA.  This seems an unlikely outcome to me.  $V progression below.

Yeah, probably not the best comparison. I don't think P/S ratio is right way to value $MA or $V, because they are so insanely profitable. I would use either a simple P/E ratio or maybe value by free cash flow for $MA and $V. Different industry than $SQ w/ far higher margins.

$SQ and $PYPL customers use $AXP $MA $V credit cards to make payments (via their Paypal accounts or square POS terminals); neither company can replace the 2.5-3.5 billion cards issued by $MA and $V. Square is a fancy payment processor/merchant acquirer primarily for SMBs IMO.

I had similar thoughts when I first read 
@naval
's tweet. In some of the replies, he mentions how $AAPL controlling the customer relationship could pressure $V and $MA profits in time. Makes me wonder how much of their pricing power is tied to their brand power.

But these cards can be completely replaced by digital/mobile interfaces that access their networks w/o hurting $MA or $V one bit. Indeed, this shift is a huge catalyst, because if you're just using an app to pay for things, there is 0% chance you're paying w/cash instead.

$MA, $V & $AXP aren't in my inverse circle of lesser incompetence. I don't understand how they will sustain their ability to take a cut on payments in a digital, cashless world.
They're basically useless in my life.
No idea why one would own them over 1) $FB, 2) $TCEHY, 3) $BABA.

$V $MA can continue to lose lots of share in India and still grow very very fast because the pie will be expanding for a long time.

Help me understand why they are so great. Is the the FCF margins? I know they are cash cows. Is that it? Rev growth seems stagnant? I'm long newer entrants in payments space like $SQ, $STNE, $PAGS but i guess investing in $V and $MA is a different proposition? Thanks

This is a pretty hyperbolic statement. Not grounded in reality. Even with his belief a more realistic assumption would put the ""zero"" volume for $V $MA somewhere in the 10+ year range.

1) I'm not taking credit?

2) Of course investors have been doing great in this space for a long time. $MA is up 1,390% and $V up 890% last 10 years. Fantastic stocks! I've been writing articles on them for years and would never dream to say I was the one who discovered them!

I knew a prominent Wall Street analyst that said $AXP, $MA & $V we’re doomed as online retailers would introduce their own frictionless payment systems that would spread everywhere else. I agreed with him as it made sense.  That was 1996. #gofigure

Def of value completely arbitrary, macro changes, indices change. Can your valuation models adjust to these changes? The “p” should be replaced by PV of future cash flows and not the current market value. Q: what is a fair P/B for $V, $MA? How do you think about this question?

Agree entirely. The Magellan portfolio is replete with high quality stocks where the manager believes their competitive advantage (& hence growth rates) are reasonably sustainable (see

$SQ will get taken out eventually, perhaps by $AAPL, $V, or $MA. Definitely won't be $FB that acquires $SQ though, for the same reason $GOOGL didn't buy $TWTR, Google and Facebook think Twitter is a joke run by a bunch of clowns, and thus far, Twitter has not proved them wrong.

The 1 case where I'm ok with it is the initializer pattern:  ""$v = if (-not (test-path variable:v)) { ""initial value""}"" but that is better served with  an explict operator ""$v ?= ""Initial value"". On the other hand ""$v = (-not (tp variable:v)) ? ""Initial value"" : $v"". Not so much.

Buy a piece of both is the lesson.  Applies to any strong industry.  Don't try to pick ""the winner"", grab multiple possible winners.

Blockchains aren't just a fad or a buzzword, but are already being deployed at large companies like $SBUX and $WMT.

Improved capital efficiency will unlock billions of dollars for businesses each year, which is a significant opportunity for investors!

$V will be as successful as $MA was with its 2016 attempt (they do the back end the banks do the instalments, diff fees, diff rules per bank etc). APT value add with referrals back to retailers so can charge more (+ they are the most popular with consumers).

Don't see how it's a double edged sword. $fb switch to mobile came at lower monetization rates but was hugely accretive to FCF/intrinsic value.

Given $v and $ma fixed costs, Any additional revenue is a huge positive.

3) Pay with Venmo.  This is the only monetization option where $PYPL keeps 100% of economics but is most difficult to scale.  More importantly, also in competition with $V and $MA core business.  2 sided markets hard to scale, especially if incumbents already well positioned

2) Instant Transfer.  This is enabled by push pay from $V (Direct) $MA (Send).  $PYPL charges the user a 1% fee (previously $0.25) for the real time “cash out” of funds from Venmo balance to a debit card linked DDA, this fee then shared with $V $MA.      https://google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/10/12/17968872/venmo-instant-transfer-fee-increase…

* take a look at how to solve this with modules

* document that version $V will baseline against 11, ship as a module, and only export packages $X, $Y, $Z

$HL LN expensive by global standard (higher P/E than $V on lower growth), but its ""quality"", ""growth"" & non-£ aspects mean scarcity value among UK funds (esp with Brexit). Some bad practices but not on same lvl as $SJP LN. Nice bounce from worst of Woodford news. I don't hold it.

It’s notable that Tumblr was sold for less than $3M

It’s more  notable that it

- lasted 12 years in a changing digital world
- still has 100M+ MAU
- employees 100s
- ranks top 100 websites

An incredible feat

Shorter duration assets trade at lower multiples b/c reinvestment risk is super real. 

IF the bond market is right then why isn’t $v worth 60x and $fb worth 40x? I know that sounds crazy. But, the risk free asset is your alternative..

10 Stocks to Buy for September

Started buying $SHOP around $150-175. It is my biggest holding. Roku around $105- $128. $ZM around $85. $TTD was around $140. $MDB around $85. Whole idea for the question is to brainstorm companies under $50B. Valuation high right now.I also own $MSFT,$MA, $V etc in Portfolio.

People who needed Fin exposure were hiding in $MA / $V. They got hit today despite strong Fin tape but as you can see, they are treated more as growth since they don't have the interest rate risk the banks have

Couldn’t see tweet you’re replying to but my two cents:  1) Not in $V best interest to kill $SQ.  As network (toll road) they want more endpoints (on-ramps), especially ones like $SQ that are innovating new use cases, driving acceptance and pushing other endpoints to do more

Malone did try to buy $NFLX through $DTV and was correct. Look at $V today, you've got $JPM on on side, you've got $PYPL on the other side in e-commerce. You've also got $SHOP, $AMZN. The landscape is totally different from the days of installing terminals at corner stores.

IMO, SRC is hardly a threat, for the same reason that Visa Checkout was not a threat. Consumer behavior is not easy to change; which is also why the pays never took off. So $V $MA have ceded mind-share in an important channel to someone else and cannot get it back.

Central bank intervention has become permanent.
It will never stop now.
They will never normalize.
Why? Because they can’t.
The global financial system cannot stand on its own.
Blowing ever higher asset bubbles is the only choice they have or risk an epic unwind.

Most aren't. So stick to treasury bills. That's cool too. I don't have a risk profile. I have a edge case return profile. But now I have to pay school fees so cashflow is important too. FYI - you can get 1,000% returns without VC.

One problem.  $GOOG & $FB aren't in the tech select index.  This index does have top 4 holdings to $V and $MA though...which may not be what some consider pure tech.

I have 2 buckets of businesses I think about. One is high ROIC now (say $V or $MA), other's are what I call the Terminal Value Club: businesses that are very good now, but that I have near as possible certainty that will be very good 30,50 years into the future.

Bad form to criticise Buffett and doesn’t look like their own fund has a 15% position in $V and $MA. But Berkshire’s industrial businesses will likely slow and the lack of buybacks is a puzzle - I assume this is simply market timing and if so, not silly to ask why buy $BRK now

For portfolio management purposes I look at them as one combined position similar to $V $MA and don't let it get above my ""max"" position size.

Nice thread Matt. 

Long $MA (5 yrs) & $V (10 yrs). Main reasons I love these two.
1)How relatively predictable their Businesses are ,and yes those juicy margins (enabling Div/Buybacks).
2)How low volatile their stocks are.

So smooth & great returns. Very hard combo to find.

Best I can come up w/ is that it gives $MA edge in approaching banks, b/c it can legit say, ""We do cards, we do ACH, we can support whatever you want to do."" As opposed to $V, which has to explain that Visa Direct is capable ACH replacement.

But is it more than that?

Good stuff. My biggest question remains: Does $MA's acquisition of Vocalink give it a clear advantage in the Fast ACH battles or is $V management correct that Visa Direct can do everything VocaLink can do?

Great analysis on $MA, thanks! How would you compare $MA to $V? Both are great companies, I've had a $V in my portfolio for years and wondering if you think there's a point to add also $MA? Or are they too close to each other (basically same risks and potential)?

So hard to know b/c all I'm left w/ is $MA saying its the final piece to puzzle while $V says VocaLink acquisition is practically meaningless.

Does seem to be real advantage in B2B wars too, though.

But that's my biggest question...

All the payment processors have to pay $MA $V etc yet they only report revenues and deduct these fees under COGS

$SQ was trying to be sneaky imo and its good the regulator has put an end to this.

I don't agree, actually. In $SQ's case adjusted was better. Most companies boost their revenue if they adjust, but $SQ lowers it.

It has to pay a lot of service fees to $V and $MA and in the adjusted revenue these are taken out. So it gave a cleaner picture.

I just noticed that all of these guys (Revolut, Transferwise, Monzo, Monese, N26...) use $MA instead of $V. Do you have any idea why? It's always hard to say whether your prefer $V or $MA, with many people owning both stocks. Interesting that all these startups use $MA.

Literally don’t know anyone who owns $msft and $v for the divvy. Was more a general comment about how the media is behind the curve and IBD is mostly retail focused! Institutional investors have been on the divvy trade for a while.

Depends what you mean by “these stocks”. If you’re referring to Utilities & REITs, I’d bet their share prices would struggle. Not sure if you read the actual dividend articles in this IBD yet or not, but they reference stocks like $MSFT $MCD $JNJ & $V, which could still excel.

I think their move to lower interchange fees shields them from that. At the end of the day, anti monopoly regulations are there to protect customers. By lowering fees, $V and $MA pre-empt that and hence are on the same side with the regulator

Good lens through which to look at $V/MA’s core business, deconstructing drivers of growth (source: V 2017 investor day)

1) Net revenue growth driven by cash penetration and underlying PCE growth (essentially a tax on consumer spend), share and pricing less a factor historically

$V currently 29x forward P/E on mid teens EPS vs $MA closer to 34x and high teens.  The 5x gap is highest ever today, largely based on market’s perceptions on future growth prospects

Long all 3 too. Agree $FB business is concentrated but optionality is probably underrated, will have multiple levers to pull in time. ""You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus"". $V / $MA much loved, and rightfully so.

It's interesting. I see $FB trading at forward P/E of 21 with probably mid twenties EPS growth for a while, which could be even higher if they wanted. And then $V and $MA at what you mentioned, with less regulatory risk obv. Investing is hard.

It is hard!  $FB also 98% advertising vs $V/MA more resilient (no Q ever where payments volume declined yoy even in depth of 08/09 financial crisis for V, only one Q in 2009 for MA).  I’m long FB as well, so don’t get me wrong.  Just different exposures, risks and upsides

Agree 100%.  For long term investors the SaaS stocks are a no brainer.

Recurring revenues, growing revenues, huge gross margins and high customer retention are just some of the reasons to invest.

I would say $MA MasterCard and $V Visa too.  Margins, fees and growth.
