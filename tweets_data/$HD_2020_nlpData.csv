For example look at this $HD chart. The breakout area should be above $222.00. If you go long at that price, the stop should be around $215.50, just below the last couple of weeks lows, also below the 20MA.

This is how $SBUX and others make money, keep as few employees as possible.  Same with $HD, Burlington.  Frustrating shopping there (can't get any help) and paying counters take forever.  That's what keeps their stocks higher, reduce expenses $$$

Imagine they partnered with a site like $HD but also kinda worked like ebates used to work?

$HD pays $pins 10% of the sale - 5% goes to the customer has a cash back bonus and 5% goes to pins?

FCF is post-capex, inclusive of growth capex. Back to $HD example. ~$11B of NI, CFO of ~$13B. ~$2.5B on capex in 2020 and expected to be peak investment year for a while. Leaves ~$11B, half of that to div half other half plus some borrowing for a ~3.5% buyback.

Well no. The maximum would be 40x p/fcf aka 2.5% fcf yield. We are also talking about super mature firms that are growing at low to neglibile topline. Mature company eps~=fcf. Take $hd for example topline is 4-5% growth, fcf is ~12/13b on 240b mcap. Pays 2% divy and 3% buyback.

This time around, I went with:

$COST > $HD > $WMT > $TGT

Target has the most to lose from online shopping. WalMart is upping its e-commerce presence, but overall growth is still flat. 

Home Depot has less competition, and Costco has the best membership-based business model.

If my analysis is correct, I see Home Depot selling off and heading back to December lows. Earnings pre-market tomorrow. Stock had a long run up and all the good news is priced in. No one is talking of the #coronavirus headwinds. $DJI dropped over a 1000pts today, $HD may follow.

Tim, there are 15 cases in the US & the regular flu - the one w/o a really cool name - kills 12-60k ppl annually. I think we need to give the former Indiana Governor the benefit of the doubt. Meantime, if you need xtra masks I hit the $HD yesterday.

Agree, long $HD as well as I think it will outpace US GDP growth along with providing a reliable div. income for years, due to it's digital investments you outline above. 

The company also has a great culture that comes from it's co-founders mentality of treating employees well.

Historically $COST has grown EPS at ~10% annually. Even if we extrapolate this out for 15 (!) years further and assume an exit multiple of 25x (1.66x the market's LT average / roughly it's 10 year average), we get an IRR of 7.5%. If the multiple is 18x ( $HD / $LOW ), it's 5.2%.

A couple of song names on the market today, closed back above their 10-day SMA. $SPX came just short of that, but a simple flat or even slightly lower open Wed is one that will be by default, retaking the 10-day. HAs not closed> that since 2/20

Between $HD & $LOW there are about 4000 stores & $150B+ revenue. For anyone to ‚Äúwin‚Äù in this market against these two will not be easy & neither instant. Closest is $W with $9B business, and they have been around for more than a decade. So don‚Äôt think what you say is possible!

How does one charge managemnt fees for a portfolio in which 50% of top 40 names are ETFs and 50% of NAV is in ETFs; Other top hldgs are $AAPL, $MSFT, $DIS, $NVDA, $MSFT, $GOOG, $HD, $ATVI, $NFLX?  The only name that isn't an ETF or massive component of the market is $TSLA (kudos)

$HD goes ex-dividend on the 3rd. This dividend growing monster has been paying increasing dividends for the last 11 years. Debt is a watch out, as is the negative equity, but it's a company with further growth potential. We don't own it yet but it's in our watch list.

I mean it looks nice, cedar is expensive but you‚Äôre rich. 

I‚Äôd recommend just using standard 2x6 (untreated, will last for years).

Measure out what plot size you want and have the person at $HD cut the 2x6 for you.

Then put these stones in the corners.

100% agree that $XLY has been helped by $AMZN for sure, and $HD is in tight consolidation, but if $XLY starts getting money its way, underlying names should also start to rise regardless of weights, no? There are quite a few names in top 10 holdings that have been consolidating.

Yes, Breakout if retest breakout area is confirmation to go long
Consolidation right under breakout area is also +ve sign

It can consolidate after breakout  but that usually means its getting ready for next leg up. Check $HD breakout and other charts on my feed, you ll get idea

We lost $CHK and $HTZ as well as multiple retailers/gyms. Yet the Fed is buying up debt from $HD $MSFT $GS $V and $AAPL. You cannot argue the Fed is keeping us afloat, especially not main street. The Fed is engaging in selective market fascism over free market capitalism.

It's a well oiled machine.

$HD crushing with home improvements on the rise.

Housing are getting older in the U.S. going to need repairs for a long time.

$AMZN doesn't provide a lot of these products.

Great company to be sure but here's my logic ... people can look for gold with $HD or $LOW but I'd rather go after the picks and shovels they'll use to fix up their homes a la $JPM or $V for example. #Retail comes and goes but #money always gets spent.

Does that make sense?

$HD trades at 28x earnings compared to their 5yr avg of 22

The Forward P/E is still 25x

$HD is operating in an environment that is seeing low rates + people spending TONS of time in their homes, which equates to owners looking to make those improvements they have put off

Being the best at a niche is another. $AMZN sells furniture and home goods. $ESTY and $W are growing exponentially. 

A lot of what I get an $HD and $LOW I can buy on $AMZN. But $AMZN hasn‚Äôt killed the hardware industry, or companies like $AZO.

It is usually represented as a percentage.

$HD pays out $6 per share for their dividend.

$HD current market price is $285.00.

I didn‚Äôt pick $T because it‚Äôs a risk (media, satellite broadband). $V and the whole financial biz could change. $MO because smoking is trending down.

I think home sales and home improvement will have tailwinds for at least a year.  Trying to figure out the best way to play this trend, but avoid the crowded trades like $HD, $SHW, & $WHR.

Homebuilders ($KBH, $MTH) & building products companies ($MAS, $AMWD) look interesting.

Sustainability. ""Can people live without it?""

 Mobile phones, cigarettes, snacks, alcohol = No

 Stationary, branded clothes, watches? Yes.

Simple reason why I haven't invested in some good companies like $HD and $TITAN

95% of revenue comes from dog supplies and DIY fencing parts. They have a strong presence on every e-commerce site - $AMZN, $WMT, $HD, and $CHWY - and a solid site of their own. Looks like small cap consumer retail in for a windfall due to covid trends.

I like $VYM more than $SPHD. 

$MSFT, $HD, $O, $AAPL are all not in $VYM, so you'd be covered nicely with those along with $VYM.

I do prefer $GRGW to smaller American growers & Canadian names. 

My only concern is there‚Äôs no legal barrier to entry for its business. 

$HD can focus on hydroponics if it wanted to BUT seems like $GRGW has developed great relationships with MSOs.

Congrats on the returns

The market rally over the last 4, 8, 12 years is largely due to innovation, profit growth and low rates. $AMZN $AAPL $FB $GOOG $MSFT profits are up 5-10x since 2016 so their stocks deserve to be higher. Same for $HD $COST $TGT $JPM. These companies would have dominated anyway.

That way you can add more companies that are growing their dividends 10%+ year by year. So your income grows!

In 2 months also, I doubt $MSFT crossing 250, $HD touching 325.
These targets are good for 6 months from now on if we stay bullish imo.

Problem with these posts are people buy calls 1 month away and then they suffer losses.

This year the Cash Flow from Operations had a huge jump vs prior year.
This is mostly from Accounts Payable, also reflected in the balance sheet the increase in liabilities.
This is probably from an increase in payment terms to suppliers.
