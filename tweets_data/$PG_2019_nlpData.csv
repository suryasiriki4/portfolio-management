$PG is been on a strong run as of late, I think we see a pullback soon to $100 before legging up further. It's current move has been pretty much straight up with no real pullback. Stocks trading at all time highs can be tough technically to trade b/c not much info to go off of.

Besides $PEP, I'd go with $CLX, $PG, $TSN, $STZ on the US side. 
$ATD.B, $ADW.A,  on the Cdn side. I'm pretty sure that those 6 stocks will greatly outperform $GIS for the next 5 years. But that's just me; I'm not a big fan of the food industry for the past couple of years.

Agreed. And same. I’m starting to balance out my portfolio with some value investing in dividend stocks and it’s really rounding out nicely. $PG for the last year has been amazing and been averaging into $F little more rick but at 7.8% can’t really beat it. Any dividends for you?

agree.  people are more interested in ""exciting"" investments with crap fundamentals like $LYFT, $UBER or ""wework"".. and get roped into them by the fin-media.. I'm more excited about  $PG, $MCD, $DIS, or $WM.  toiletries,  fastfood, mega-media and trash!

I've used TM triggers on several stocks ($ATVI, $GOOGL, $WMT, $PG) w/gr8 backtest results over the last several years. All have blown up cause of the shenanigans of the last 3 days. I know the backtester can't account for tweets, etc. Should we just ignore all triggers for now?

Agree with this whole thread, but in case of $PG, a massive impairment really messes with TTM earnings. P/OCF is around 20, which is still not what I would ever want to pay for a staple with near 0% annual sales growth, but wildly different story versus its 80+ P/E.

The fact that $PG is the top holding in $MTUM is interesting, initially. But then I take a quick glance and $PG is indeed trending in the upper level of relative strength, so, I'll take a closer look at some of these things and share my observations.

If $PG goes up every day pays a dividend and also is a defensive play why would folks not jump in. But what no one is realizing is if investing was so easy everyone would be millionaires. There is no such thing as a free lunch.

V. the past, $PG revenue growth of 2.5% /3.1% in Q1/Q2 19 is impressive.

However, MS estimates of 3.9%, 4.3%, 4.6%, 4.9% growth over next 4 Qs seem exaggerated. Difficult for a co. this size to add avg $2.5bn (4%) annual sales in a jiffy.

Is *premiumisation* the key reason?

$PG Yearly Sales Growth:
06/17: (-)0.4%
06/18: +2.7%
06/19: +1.3%
(From Yahoo! Finance)

Given that 06/17 was a below-par year (degrowth over '16), 2.7% in 18 should be normalized. For a co. with such scale, growth rates will be muted due to the base effect.

Sticking w/ the $PG example, look at their shampoo brands (like head & shoulders).

It’s really easy / cheap to make your own shampoo (I’ve had friends who have done it), but it’s not egregiously priced so my guess is why I can’t name a single DTC shampoo company?

Definitely hindsight bias, but razor blades and glasses just seem like really obvious first DTC categories given the egregious pricing practices of incumbents.

There's plenty of $PG products that (appear to be) doing just fine - even w/ the secular shifts you've mentioned.

Again, PegNet is a protocol, so it has no ""sells""

I do expect PegNet to be a top 30 crypto in the next year 

I expect use of pegged value in crypto to be the basis of significant DeFi applications in 3 years, and PegNet to be a major player.

$SBES - Our CEO, Robert Xu, is all for going public via RTO/reverse merger. He just did this with Zalemark/AeroponLeaf. He bought $SBES in ‘19 & it’s next. David Xu was acting CFO of Zalemark, and now he’s CFO of RockySaaS. It’s not a coincidence, folks. They are a team.

It's mystery co. day!  Same rules, the co. is real, the financials are divided by a random number.  

Please provide your estimate of intrinsic value, current trading price and industry.  I will reveal the name on Monday.  

FWIW this is a N.American co.

1. Bulls make money.
2. Bears make money.
3. Hogs get slaughtered.
