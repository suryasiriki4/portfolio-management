Looking for a b/o of upper r-line to pop out of rising wedge but that full candle above lower resistance is a good look & might be an indicator. Either way, I like as much bullish confirmation as possible so upper resistance has my eye

Note on iphones - last year Apple shipped 78.3 million over 14 weeks in Q1. This year was 77.3 million over 13 weeks in Q1. So on an adjusted per week basis shipments were up - along with the giant leap in ASP of +$102 per device.

That was the case in the past, but profits from Model 3 at 5,000/wk and beyond will prove too much to invest wisely. $TSLA is not too far away from $AAPL's too-much-cash problem, and I know this sounds crazy now, but will become apparent in ""3 months maybe, 6 months definitely.""

I can tolerate his ""eccentricity"" but he has run off his day to day operators. Jobs was a tweaker/perfectionist but he left day to day to those with that skill set. IMO, $AAPL today under Cook suffers the opposite problem. He lacks vision put knows Excel.

If you invested $10,000 in $AAPL on December 12, 1980...

You probably freaked the hell out and sold it on March 11, 1981 when it was down 25% and your human brain realized what a mistake you probably made.

You mumbled at your dog and wondered how to tell your then-fianc√©.

$AAPL works for one constituency: its shareholders, aka owners. If politicians want them to puff up paychecks at rates greater than economics suggest, they need to cough up $900billion to buy out Apple and then they can call the shots all they want.

Also, $AAPL shares closed at $188.84 before the weekend. Even in developed countries, I‚Äôd wager many people can‚Äôt easily afford even one share. If Apple equity were tokenized, though, anyone could purchase a fractional share according to their means.

Lol. Small world. I have tweeted positive and negative on $TSLA in the past. I think Musk is a promotional crook but I think the shorts have high odds of being wrong. This feels like $AAPL way back when. Or $NFLX.  Or better yet, $AMZN. Odds of such are quite high in fact.

HODLERs invest(despite their emotions). Traders trade. $AAPL , $TSLA,  $FB can all be shorted and longed. If there was no volatility like this, we would all be hodlers :)

I guess Time will tell on this front, but either way. $FB has f-ed up on many fronts, trusting them with my money will NEVER happen, and I have NEVER trusted or have liked a single $AAPL product in my entire life. Just person preferences.

Since Kanye has been in the news lately, let's check up on Kim's Christmas portfolio:

(Returns estimated since 12/22/17 for simplicity)

$NFLX +76%
$AMZN +27%
$ADDYY +28%
$AAPL 0%
$DIS -7%

Equally-weighted, he's up 25%. Didn't even have to pay 2 & 20 for it.

$NQ_F is up almost $100 and $AAPL is struggling to hang green. No technical damage yet, but keep an eye on it. She was actually still red when I unusually said $NQ_F up $54 is a slap in the face to Bears on the back of $NFLX dumping.

Hey Tails,

You jumped in late here and I think maybe you didn‚Äôt read the original post.

The OP was saying that Tesla will likely end up like $AAPL and only have 15% of the market share.

I‚Äôd be ok with a Tesla that had 15% market share.

 Wonder what that‚Äôd do tho the shares?

Looking to week ahead - 

$VIX $SPY daily point to weakness to open week. If we break thru 282.50, I'd move out of way quickly. Similarly with $VIX above 200D (14.50 area)

Think we have a $SPY 50D test coming up unless bulls fill Fri gap quickly

Ok, sorry to spoil the party, but I need to reign in the excitement a bit...

Buying LTC is extremely risky. I expect us to have a multi-year bear market like the one we just had where LTC dropped 90% in value ($48 to $4). So if you can't handle LTC dropping to $20, don't buy!

1. Today, Apple introduced new iPhones, but it was clear that the company‚Äôs focus was on the new Watch.

I think this represents more than just a business decision. On some level, the makers at Apple feel guilty about the technology they‚Äôve shared with the world.

$TSLA owes its existence since the IPO to benevolent investors who keep pumping more and more fresh $ into this (ad)venture.

The board is getting paid $$$. How do their salaries make sense while other huge, public (and PROFITABLE) companies such as $AAPL pay their BoD far less?

Sonnenfeld is proposing a fix that could work at $GE (mature tech leader) for an emerging challenger. It is as short-sighted as saying that Tim Cook should have run $AAPL in 1997, and makes just as little sense.

Leadership and vision are not what we turn to CFO/COO wisdom for.

BlackBox Stocks Twitter Alert Statistics.
Of 70 Roulette Alerts so far this month, 52 of them had a 15% gain within the week, and 48 had a 25% gain within the week. 
Those are pretty good numbers.

Good analysis on $AAPL Weekly & Daily Chart. I observed that 200 EMA has been support since 2009 low.134-136 Week Symmetry between lows since 2009. It took only 11 weeks for $83 move down & watching for a 50-61.8% retracement by end of next Q.
