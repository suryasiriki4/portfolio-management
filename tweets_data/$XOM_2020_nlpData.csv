Good point, but would you say it's different for asset managers. They would generally have longer investment periods if I'm not mistaken. 

I'm not surprised that they've made good shareholder returns in the past. Though in past 10 years, definitely less so. $XOM made -26%.

Don't know if your like to short.  I have been watching $XOM and crude for a year straight.  I just saw a bearish break and squeeze (consolidation break) in both to the downside.  
There is also a weekly squeeze in $xom.  GL

Can confirm. 

I sell SaaS to upstream O&G. 

There are hundreds of mom & pop operations that think they’re the next $XOM. 

They have no money or projects but they pretend they’re a major player. 

Pull them out of the pipeline ASAP.

$XOM is down 5% YTD on this oil crater move and it's at the 52 week low so that is huge under-performance relative to the market. If oil collapses back to low $50's I'd say there could be some value there in addition to the dividend.

I am playing it to drop.  I’ve been shorting the market since Friday.  Specifically $xom which just released from compression, and now $eem and $hd.  EEM obvious reasons.  HD cause it is volatile like $AXP and as lucrative.  Problem is $axp not showing same weakness as HD.

CHART OF THE DAY: Exxon shares have closed today at their lowest in nearly 10-years (October 2010). Once the gold-standard in Big Oil, Exxon is now buffeted by rising capex, low oil and gas prices, a disastrous shale deal (XTO) and concerns about climate change | #OOTT $XOM

I have to say, I think Guyana and the Permian are two very different things.  $XOM and $HES lucked into Guyana working....no doubt. But resource is immense. Permian was a name drop to add sizzle, and add shortcycle albeit high cost inventory.  Early days, Guyana seems legit

ExxonMobil used to have bragging rights as the world's most valuable public company. But a stunning $184 billion has been wiped off Exxon's market valuation since its 2014 peak. That's equivalent to the entire value of Boeing, or nearly 1.5 Teslas. https://cnn.it/2ttPppM",,,,,['https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1278259160644227073/MfCyF7CG_mini.jpg'],https://twitter.com/bmcushing/status/1225217481989591041

$XOM should slash their dividend to zero.  Gets no credit for it and can save billions to either 1) pay down debt (although it’s low interest, so maybe optimize 2) build a cash balance warchest or 3) invest that cash in renewables. Either way,  agree with you, wrong direction!

Buffett acted similarly recently in the oil sector. After he sold $XOM, he increased his Phillips 66. Then he sold 95% of it. $OXY has lost over half of its principal value recently.

Moneyflow in $XOM has been steadily improving, even though price hasn't yet. China's oil consption is down 20%. The good news is that seasonality is going to flip to positive soon.

$XOM is yielding 6.56%! It’s getting hard to ignore w/ the 10 year at 1.339%. I think Oil may see $42s, but it’s pretty cheap here. Last time is was near $55 was in 2010! We’re not going to run the world on kale chips just yet. But you’ve been correct w/ the ESG fad.

I have been in the red with $XOM for some time and have been wanting to lower my cost basis. My issue is that they are covering their dividend by taking on more debt. Which I would be ok with if I felt like oil prices were trending upwards. So thus far I have remained patient.

Just about anything I already own. Plus, look at big oil dividend yields. $RDS.B hasn't cut its dividend since World War II. $BP, $OXY both raised dividend again recently. $XOM has raised dividend 37 yrs in a row. Historically, they do it in April.

Over the longest timeframe, stocks are generally better than gold. 

Which one is likely to outperform for a long time depends on their relative valuations. 

In 2012, stocks were the better buy, but Buffett got unlucky with his example stock with $XOM.

Any of the small companies that are also on my Zombie list will die quickly. The idea of zombies is that they live paycheck to paycheck (new financing). To make the Zombie list they are already on the edge.

$XOM is good, but I'm researching today. Looking at $VET (which just cut div by 50% & stated they have solid plans for operation under a Covid emergency). Also watching $VLO because it's a fuels play, so may benefit more quickly if consumers come back but oil stays low.

With Exxon Mobil $XOM shares sinking below the 2008 GFC lows (!!!), they need to suspend their entire dividend, NOW. This is a sinking ship that is reaching alarmingly low levels of liquidity and cash on hand relative to near-term debt obligations, at the worst possible time. 1/5

Dividend is an important focus for $XOM & they've been adding debt to increase the div payout last few years. I assume they'll maintain it for a while to give oil a chance to rebound. Not my expertise, but I'd guess 12 months out at $40  oil probably OK, but at <$35 I'd be wary.

Senate R bill:

1. One-time payment up to $1,200 per adult. 

2. Won't get this unless income reaches $23,500. 

3. So 64 million households with incomes below $50,000 would get less than $1,200.

4. These are same Rs who gave wealthy and corps $2,000,000,000,000 in tax cuts.

Even with the price of oil really struggling, $XOM has an incredible portfolio of productive assets & has shown a willingness for acquisitions. It's also selling at < 5X cash flow.

Just to be clear, I have no investments here and that's unlikely to change. But when there's no sign of hope in the near future and people are just bailing on stuff like $XOM that they were comfortable owning at 2x - 3x current levels, there's probably some LT opportunities.

I certainly agree, and 5+ yrs is how I like to invest.

$XOM would hate to cut its dividend, as institutional funds depend on it. But I agree it's likely, since there's a lot of LTD coming due this year.

Those payments take priority. But I'd love to see a huge buyback as well.

Using $XOM as bet for oil end game. 
Disruption “for the sake of” is not a business model.

One of the top questions I heard at the start of 2020 was could it finally be time for energy stocks?

Huge underperformance and cheap on nearly all measures.

do you currently have holdings in oil?

What is next in the #oil market? Here are my expectations:

- OPEC+ will finalize & approve the cut tonight with or without #Mexico.  This will have a limited impact on the market in the short run

- Aramco will announce an OSP that reflects the production cut. Very bullish.

Maybe. People call it the Trump pump, but I call it the Trump dump. The $SPY gapped up and then dumped for 5 hours. People just bought into the close. #theStrat on $XOM was based on $XLE stalling out at the top of the broadening formation. It was great to see it go back green tho

I’ve been buying the big integrated companies like $XOM & $CVX. They’re diversification from exploration, extraction, refinement and sale across many products will get them through. Probably acquire bankrupt assets as well.

Fun fact - $XOM is the largest US Nat Gas producer!

Agreed -

I own $CVX which I think is a stronger company than $XOM, and $VZ - again feel it's better positioned than $T.

But I had my eye on all four.  Just went with the plays I felt more likely to profit.

I own both!

$T is a slow grower which I’m not so excited about and can’t see a world where they grow faster either.

$XOM is probably a value buy at the moment. Also facing long term headwinds, but probably still safe.

I’ve had my eye on $T and $XOM

Why I like them? Well they
-Can be bought relatively low compared to 52 week low
-Have high but realistic yields

$T Has 5G and HBO Go money coming

$XOM has a dividend payment coming up soon and real world implications point to a strong rebound

When I look at potential trades, I think about the kinds of trades that will seem obvious in hindsight.

One day we will look back at XOM with a 10% dividend yield and say, what the hell was I thinking?

That's exactly my point. Even with the low prices, Aramco itself is fine. Just like $XOM, but probably better. So why suddenly start taking loans?

Not sure about re-entry in the future. Suncor $SU is well run, but at the end of the day they are dependent on the price of oil which they can’t control. I own $XOM, so I’ll be monitoring them too.

Look, even with low oil prices, Aramco itself is fine. Just like $XOM, but probably better. So why suddenly start taking loans? Loans are better than depleting cash only if the rates are so good that Aramco can do better reinvesting its money elsewhere.

I think for me personally and the way I invest it’s $MMM without a doubt. I think it’s a case of risk and reward. $XOM has a much higher upside I think but the potential downside doesn’t sit well with me at all. $MMM should be a nice long term hold.

$XOM has the higher upside from this levels but more downside as well.

Dividend cut could still happen and demand for oil will be lower down the line.

$MMM is the safer pick.

I picked $Xom because I know we need oil and gas but apparently picking a company like $tsla is the winner. I don’t feel comfortable with my entire net worth sitting in a company that can tank on a single tweet saying the stock price is too expensive.

The journey has started. At least for a few of them trying to diversify to renewables. Issue is profitability of those vs O&G . $CVX, $XOM are the ones that seem to be staying the course in trying to reduce the unit cost within O&G.

Well, you can get your RothIRA through anybody. What matters is what you put into it. If you starting it, can’t go wrong with $KO, $JNJ, $XOM, $SBUX...just a few. The Roth is after tax earning. You pay th ex tax now, but in 40+ years when you are ready to cash out, it’s tax free!

The free press is an important part of our democracy.

They don’t always get it right, but every American should be upset when you see erosions of freedom like this.

On the safer side, dividend aristocrat stocks are classics, like $JNJ, $KO, etc

On the riskier side, I’m long on energy stocks like $ET, $NGL, or oil $XOM $CVX but the future is murkier

Dividend payout % are changing everyday though, so always be careful and do your research

$XOM daily chart.  Similar to $CVX and if it can get above $47.5ish, could have room to dance its way to the 200-day at $58ish.  Don't trade these too often and mostly they just slug along.  If willing to slug along, could be a trade in there somewhere if $SPY keeps recovering.

Most of them were in pretty good businesses to start with!

And your point of moving to new businesses, I think you're opening yourself up to a LOT of survivorship bias there. If you made Mark Leonard CEO of $XOM I'm not buying it. He could do well but I'm not going to bet on it.

Btw it was really good, love to hear a special detailing $OXY and how it will either survive or not coming out of this mess.
The info on $CVX and $XOM on the fiscal control was great.

$XOM was trading at 2002 prices this year. That dividend is paid from taking on debt. Oil and Gas as an industry is the biggest destroyer of capital next to Junior gold miners.

I am already long $XOM. That would just be adding to a current position.

I reinvest dividends every month unless i have unexpected expenses.

Then i turn dividends to cash to pay for things and then go back to reinvesting.

Alger Management is pushing fake data to hype a BUBBLE.

Top five market cap in 2000 were $MSFT $GE $CSCO $XOM and $WMT

Zero chance their free cash flow (however defined) was just 2% of $SPY. Or only 11% of market cap.

Interesting because it doesn’t feel that way anymore. Big cap tech is dominating and driving all the gains in the indexes. 

I wonder if the rise and fall of $GE $IBM $XOM and others that used to lead the S&P are the reason why the market cap weighted index underperformed?

No more oil for me for a while! I got caught up in the ephouria of $RDS.B & $XOM last year. I’ll be feeling it for a while. 

When oil majors become true diversified energy companies and blend with utilities, I’ll pay attention to them again.

What you do with the cash is not relevant for this study. You could sell $AMZN in 2015 to buy $NFLX, or you could sell $XOM to buy $NFLX. You would be much better off by doing the latter than the former although on the surface your decision to buy NFLX 5 years back looks great.

Here's a great short thread on 'Dividend Aristocrats'

Why?

A Dividend Aristocrat is a company that reliably pays out and increases its dividend year on year. 

The minimum amount of time before a company can reach the aristocrat title is 25 straight years of payouts.

Good info, value/income oriented investors should take a look at $PFE which has an attractive valuation. $CVX also is a good buy for income investors looking for yield due to its solid financial footing. I would stay away from $WBA &  oil and gas industry name $XOM, high risks.

$MSFT looks to me to have highest likely ROI over the long term. $AAPL will grow but likely slower imo but still always a good bet. $T great dividends but not much growth opportunity. $XOM could recover strong and gain maybe 30% but long term could struggle.

I do understand and the payout ratio is extremely high. But do we have anything in this world to replace oil? No. So obviously the world needs the oil in many years to come. 

The oil price is gonna go up again and $XOM, $CVX and the others will continue to make money.

I took a short look at it now. It’s interesting, I’ll give it that. But the world still needs oil no matter how you twist and turn on it, and the ones that are gonna survive? Big oil companies like $XOM, $CVX, etc. So I’m not worried really.

If $ET cuts their dividend, I’ll pull the plug there.

Over the last 6 years $XOM have paid ~ $20 B more in dividends than their FCF. The good years have been just ok, the bad years have been terrible. The debt is still low which can keep the dividend raises a few more years. Never jumped in due to this.

$RDS.B and $BP both look to be focusing more on renewables now and cut their dividends.  $XOM and $CVX continue to march ahead as planned, but Exxon's recent news about stopping employee 401k match means they're trying to do everything possible to avoid a cut.

I’m buying and holding $XOM. Fully integrated behemoth that can withstand these headwinds and will most likely acquire smaller competition that’s not fully integrated. Also being the countries largest Nat Gas producer helps.

I am prepared for a cut, and will add more if so.

Over the last 6 years $XOM have paid ~ $20 B more in dividends than their FCF. The good years have been just ok, the bad years have been terrible. The debt is still low which can keep the dividend raises a few more years. Never jumped in due to this.

Depends on how you define ""logical"". Their logic is that by decreasing cost of debt, better access to capital, companies will have more cash to keep from laying off workers. Meanwhile $XOM is laying off workers so it can maintain its dividend.

Yeah crazy. $XOM plans to stop contributing to its employees’ retirement plans to further cut costs and protect its shareholder dividend.

My fear with $XOM is the same with all oil is that they’re getting hit with Covid AND oil issues right now. They’re suspending their 401k match to employees which makes me nervous the dividend could be next

Truthfully, my fav dividend stock is $V despite the yield being so low

$MO and $XOM are similar stocks as in high dividend yield aristocrats, slightly undervalued price, but probably arent going to see much price movement up or down anytime soon because the company has some kind of barrier. Debt, economy, public opinion.

Wow. Underscoring how BP is playing catch-up here... the deal nets Equinor a $1bn capital gain.

Equinor paid only $180m to acquire these licences only a few years ago, back when BP was still resisting setting climate targets. twitter.com/emilygosden/st…

45% of this ETF is $XOM $CVX. It's probably the only ETF more lopsided than $QQQ $XLK are with the FAANGs.

If you MUST play this sector just buy the two majors & collect the 9% divvies. September seasonality is bad on this ETF but firms up a little Oct-Dec so maybe wait til EOM.

$XOM doesn't set the price of oil/gas. The market does! They can't charge $3 if the market rate is $2.50

If $SBUX raised prices 5%, would anyone notice/change brands? A few may, but most won't notice!

A small cut is absolutely necessary if $WTI does not increase soon. However, the div cut may be priced into $XOM already. Uncertainty around the cut is at least part of the low price now.

No, honestly, shorting anything that is down 55% YTD is beating a dead horse.

For the reference, Doc and I selling puts on $WFC.

I know it's a cliche phrase but ""they are too big to fail"" at these levels.

Same principle applies to $F, $XOM.

$XOM have always been a fast follower, rarely developing new technology first (like $RDS with deepwater, LNG or independents with unconv).  That's their prerogative.  But when something is proven, they dive in.  Could be that way with renewable.  Not everyone needs to lead.

Which is either bullish for $MO or bearish for $XOM.  Look at the $MO financial statements - people have been super concerned about decline in smoking rates for 30+ years, vaping for 5 years. $MO has steadily increased earnings, FCF, and distributions to shareholders entire time

I call it hell. 
Some may call it ""a small setback""

Be careful calling under 30 RSI oversold without looking at context & the price action history - $XOM can spend a lot of time at some extreme low RSIs without bouncing, and the controlled nature of the selling is keeping everything tidy within the lower Bollinger.

Options Traders Are Pricing In an Exxon Dividend Cut, Analyst Says
Whether Exxon can maintain its dividend is one of the most active debates right now among energy investors. The company has a strong incentive to keep making payments at current levels.

It is not official.

Dividend is not sustainable without borrowing, cutting more Cap-EX or without an oil recovery.

Other majors like BP and Shell already cut their dividend. 

I expect XOM to do the same.

Weakness in Energy ( $XOM and $XLE) will no doubt last for awhile longer. I'm not sure that the pain is over quite yet. Hasn't formed a solid useable base yet, still going to be range bound and volatile until the base ultimately forms and everyone has given up. Not the case yet.

if you are person 1: Dont sell your shares if $XOM drops to $35, Buy the dip the company will eventually go up.

put in another 5k at $35, you now own 232 shares at an average cost of $42 and will receive $807 per year

Right; the greater fool model of US E&P: you grow and you grow and you grow and then you sell it to $XOM. Worked brilliantly for Burlington Resources to $COP; literally for XTO to XOM. Some say the sector is badly managed. Others say the idea is to get rich. Oil CEOs excelled.

 recent question re: How to fix $XOM:

—Cut dividend

—Sell (moar) non-core assets

—Buy $PXD (“But Sheffield said the Majors”...!?!”  I know, I know...)

I love $CNQ,  but it has held up better than $SU (for the right reasons), and I think $SU's midstream and downstream offer a hedge on oil prices tanking and probably match the drivers of $XOM short a bit better.  $CNQ probably a big long here.  IMHODYODD

Apparently the 70% figure was an error on XOM's part, but it's still ~50% per 
@crudegusher
 which is much higher than peers. What's curious is that $xom doesn't seem to think that this high level of retail ownership is a *bad* thing i.e. a sign that institutions have fled.

$XOM seems to trade below the discounted cash flow of its assets.  e.g. upstream assets are likely 3-7X trailing cash flow, slap a 13-20X multiple on the other stuff.

Thanks for the ideas in your wheelhouse, Jason! 

Probably staying clear of anything new for now...if $XOM gets soooo low that it could 5x or something within a couple years, I could see getting suckered in. :) This tweet may have been a cry for help more than anything!

Dividend history can change fast mate, recently happened to $RDS.B and might as well happen to $XOM. 

The point is, at some point when picking 300 companies, some of them will cut their dividends especially the Europeans. 

You still need the allocation.

With that said, I expect post-COVID that $XOM has to be worth more than $145 billion. A lot of “peak oil” priced in rn. Look at $CVX if you’re gonna bottom feed Big Oil. 2/2

I started back for good this January right before this fiasco.

To make it worse $XOM makes 11% of my port. I'm not worried since I'm in it for the long term.

Agree! Drip is the way to go and some cost-averaging.

$CVX is the only one that makes sense... Europeans can't be talking about going green just before buying a dirty old oil producer, could they? Meanwhile $XOM is borrowing money to pay the dividend, so they've got no balance sheet. Who else could it be?

It’s a cyclical stock. It's not the end of Oil, we will continue using it for many more decades before renewable energy makes a serious impact. $XOM is in a good position to ride this crisis. It's a matter of time before it rebounds.

$CVX is much easier to justify than $XOM right here. Until $XOM gets to rationalizing their dividend policy, they are just burning enterprise value and stock price. $CVX cash burn is dramatically lower and will be stronger with more options in a rebound.

$XOM had a (31%) revenue decline YOY to $135B.

They haven't released their full financial disclosure on 10-Q's - will have to wait for that

Nice divy but Q3 ER was: cost reductions & potential earnings in Guyana/Permian in '21

My #trading ideas for Q4 2020:

Long $CGC $MSOS $YOLO or any Cannabis play
Long $XOM $XLE $XOP or any Oil energy play

If #Biden wins, $MSOS $CGC rips
If #Trump wins, $XLE $XOM rips

Sell the loser & add to winner after election.

What is your favorite post election/Q4 play?",,,,,['https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1492972087119532032/hmEmFL_T_mini.jpg'],https://twitter.com/marketwizard87/status/1324670153733382144

$XOM will make it, there is massive under investment in oil supply + upcoming fracking ban. They are the only ones investing on new supply and in foreign land. The reports on oil death are an exaggeration. Even the official branch of the globalists (IMF) predicts 110 mbd in 2040

I'm not giving advice.
If I'm wrong once every decade that works with me.

I can't wait to see $VET trading at $60 and $PEY at $35 any time soon.

Keeping those stocks for all those years was bad advice. 

But hey! We'll see how $XOM vs $MSFT go in the next 18 months.

I’d bet on a big investment in integrated energy, like $CVX or $XOM. Not confident here, but that’s what I’d have done. Perhaps an increase in $GM or an infrastructure investment, but less likely. We could see an increase in $SU but not at the ~$8B level. Stay tuned... 5/

$XOM revenues are down more than 50% from what they were in 2012. So their ""underlying business"" is not seeing sustained growth. That's a requirement for the dow index, so $XOM got kicked out. I'm not seeing any reasonable arguments for why they shouldnt kick it out.Just punditry

XOM’s OCF last year at ~$64 Brent was 38% lower than in 2005 at ~$54. That degradation is present in prior years too + reflects investments made for different outlook. A big problem with much higher capex-dividend obligations. $XOM has outspent OCF by $28b since start 2019.

I drive one and I just tweeted that $XOM pitch - so that should show you how “here to stay” oil & gas are over the next 30-50 years. It’s a slow transition to sustainability. Let’s be realistic. Also, if we think $XOM isn’t pivoting behind the scenes, we’re all naive...

If the $XOM ""activist"" push is going to have any traction, it's going to need critical mass. 0.002% shareholder support won't get you there, particularly when XOM firmly treats any shareholder proposal, even those with strong support, as ""advisory"" (free)

These guys have to pay down debt. And they know that the market will kill them for increasing capex beyond 70% of cashflow, as we are all now demanding. It used to be 120% rule of thumb. DE Shaw apparently is seeking $13bn of capex at $XOM they just said $20-$25bn 2022 onwards.

You might want to look at $XOP instead of $XLE which I think has a weighting of 43% is $XOM & $CVX.      The $XLE might be ""safer"" though, which is why most non-energy investors like it over the $XOP.    Just a thought.

I don’t argue your thesis long, long term, but buying $XOM now in the low 40s, in my opinion is a good value play. It’s the long-term buyers like me who were buying significantly higher 3-5 years ago, who are in a tougher spot.

I wouldn't criticise $XOM's operations.  Certainly, they are in a tough business.  But selling the back fifty to fund the dividend at what they describe as ""below cycle trough conditions"" is questionable.

But this reminds me of the $XOM call.  When asked which projects they would pursue or divest, they noted that JV partner alignment was a consideration.  Call it an exogenous factor.  Another firm has another WACC and different assumptions, expectations, or strategic direction.

Basically I went broke trading $BTC in 2018/2019. Took my life savings of 25K and started again in 2020.

Basically made 2500% return on $XOM puts in march.

Took that 500K and rode $BTC from 4.2K to 9K.

It got too fat in childhood. It needs to get in shape to live a longer healthy life.  It has to go on severe diet, which includes capital starvation. 

The oil majors are the adults who intervened to get this child in shape!

Not opining on whether they're good investments, but you can avoid wash-sale issues by buying similar stocks - maybe $VLO or $PSX for $MPC and maybe $CVX or $XOM for $COP. Not perfect substitutes, but you only have to hold them 30 days, then can trade back. Or consider ETF $XLE.

This will never happen, for a host of reasons, not the least of which is $XOM shareholders don't want to toss money down a rathole chasing 8% ROI green projects.

$BP might decide to hive off its E&P business (or some assets therefrom) & XOM might buy that, but they'd never merge",,,,,[],https://twitter.com/PollockJaxon/status/1341112198278475777
