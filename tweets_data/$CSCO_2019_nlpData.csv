$GE THE worst heavy-cap in past 10 yrs. leadership had no vision, no execution after Jack Welch. mkt cap still at 77B. probably only one chance left for a turnaround miracle - that's 5G. if I were GE ceo, sell 1/2 non-priority SBUs and buyout $xlnx for 50B (now only at 28B).

What’s $tsla p/s? Curious",,,,,[],https://twitter.com/ThruTheTreez/status/1090373209764126722

Oh.
My.
God.

An Apple IIe. Sat in my parents’ attic for years. Decades.

And it works.

Put in an old game disk. Asks if I want to restore a saved game. 

And finds one!

It must be 30 years old.

I’m 10 years old again.

As a buyside trader with short predilections (and stature) during the Y2K era in San Francisco, I became numb to the illiterate babbling of gym-goers who resented me for telling them that $CSCO would drop from $100/sh down to $26.  I was supposedly ""evil"" & told to go back to NY.

Taking out $AAPL, $GOOGL, $CSCO, $FB paints a completely different picture for cash flow & profitability.  Major companies like $TSLA, $NFLX can’t survive without capital infusion. Going down mkt cap everything trades at >15x sales. #dotcom2.0

I too regularly mention $CSCO as the dot-com ""no-brainer"" that fell ~90% and still isn't back to its dot-com high.  Everybody said it was greatest business, greatest mgmt, greatest everything, endless growth, etc.  Nobody didn't love it.  Ditto $AMZN, $GOOGL, etc today.

Here is the other 'disruptive/new era/world changing/monopoly etc' $CSCO 

These shareholders are still holding the bag after 19 years; whilst the company's revenues/earnings have increased over the past two decades.

In late '99 and early '00, I saw plenty of 'high tech/world changing' companies trade at 25/30 times sales - both $CSCO $MSFT multiples peaked just under 30 times sales. Then, they both tanked + shareholders sat on losses for a decade or more...just sayin'

I ended up doing my trade. Sold 9/27 $csco puts @ 47.50, bought $52 calls, selling $57. Covered the $57 calls at $.03.  Still a small chance $csco gets back above $52.  I think the stock gets back above $47.50

Haha, $MKTX is in a bubble. Over 31x sales which puts it on par with $CSCO in the http://dot.com mania. Also biggest block trades are still done by bank trading desks & banks are lobbying with success to get rules loosened on trading.  Great company but 15yrs priced in.

That's not the question. I've just made a quick calculation with http://dqydj.com. Suppose you started investing at the worst possible time in $CSCO (March 20,2000, the peak). $1000 to start with and adding $100, your CAGR would b he 23.67%! (ctd)

You can only lose 100%, but you can win 5,000% and more. Invest in $1000 in 10 stocks, 3 stocks like $CSCO, $MSFT and $QCOM, 6 Pet.coms (which was really obviously bad investment at the time, but just for the sake of if it) 1 $AMZN. What would your return be, do you think?

I don't have any SPY's presently.  I do have individual holdings in $GOOG, $AAPL, $TSLA, $AMZN, $CSCO, $NKE, and $FB from this list.  I prefer pure plays as compared to indexes.  But if I was to invest in another index it would be O'Shares OGIG ETF, see:

come to think of it, cisco bought crescendo for 90m, kalpana for 207m and selsius for 145m.

big ups to braintree/venmo but it just ain't it when compared to the $MSFT or $CSCO acquisitions fior raw sales dollars.

Lots of traders lost $Millions on 12/20 $42.50 calls bet for $OXY yesterday.  It all expired worthless.  Using unusual flow to trade is a game of luck.  With our system, we care less about flow.  Catalyst, short interest, demand & suppy, price actions, volume etc. @OptionsPastor

$CSCO at a P/E of 18 CSCO is a bit cheaper than the average S&P stock. Certainly a better value than e.g. $TSLA.

Last year, I believe $CSCO made more $ on bank interest than it did from operations.  Without significant reinvestment in true innovation or very well done M&A, this stock is dead & the company’s long-term future is in danger.

I’d agree with all of it, having been a sell side guy in the tech wreck of ‘00.  $CSCO would be, say, $95 to $95.02, 1000 each side. I’d hit the bid for 1000 shares, 100 done at $95, 900 done at $93. Response was usually “sue me”.
