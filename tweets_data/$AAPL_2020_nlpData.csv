Sometimes people ask me how much they should start investing with.

My advice:

Don‚Äôt risk so much that it will ruin you, but risk enough that it will make you deal with the emotions that come with real investing.

Don‚Äôt get too high or too low, and keep learning.

Excellent thread Kyler. I think $BRK is making same mistake as $AAPL did over the past 5-8 years. Slow to repurchase stock & sit on over $100b cash + annual cash generation of over $60b. Now they have nowhere to invest the cash but repurchase after stock is up significantly.

This pull back on markets although it may have some nice rebounds along way I don't see why we wouldn't test $280-295 range short term. 

Maybe a few days rebound then some air pockets. Nothing is going to go straight down nor will it rebound w/o panic/flush out & snap back

$UAL's number 1 customer is $AAPL, $150M a year to fly to Asia. Apple buys 50 seats per day for flights to and from China for their executives. 25 to and 25 from.  Apple spends so much flying United out of SFO that they might rebuild the terminal.
theverge.com
Apple pays United so much for corporate travel it may help upgrade its SFO terminal
$150 million a year gets you a seat at the table, apparently

This is essentially selling covered calls combined with a long call spread. This is hardly the same as ‚Äúshort‚Äù AAPL. As was noted in the show this trade offers no downside protection, just boosting your returns if the stock recovers a little bit.

Yours (sir? madam?) is a very good point.
I won't condemn it -- probably some value catalyzing resources -- but if $AAPL and $TSLA are merely routing existing supplies, that's weak sauce.
HUGE praise to $F  and the many other companies retooling.

It was weird. I may have held my $ZM and $AAPL calls for longer durations had the $VIX not been rising at the same time. The second I saw a reverse signal on each trade I bailed for small gains. Base hits add up. I just saw the futures go from green to red. News driven market.

TAM usually provided by mgmt.

Organic growth is observable in quarterly filings.

Moat/optionality qualitative guesses. Company history provides clues though.

Ex: $TSLA, $AMZN, $MMM, $AAPL incredibly innovative cultures. Odds good more innovations to come.

We may or may not sell off but I have no edge in this trade any longer.  Can't win on every trade, sometimes you need to take a loss.  I do think we come down on Monday but I don't like risk here with short dated.

Here's a trick for you. Follow these big liquids. Pick the top RS names of these. To me they're $NVDA, $AMZN, $MSFT, $AAPL, $NFLX, $SQ, $PYPL, and $TSLA. Once these are given up, that's your tell to reduce or lock some down. Or, if any climax as well.

$brk.a / $brk.b started buying $aapl in 2016. Glad they have benefited from recent jump. The other stocks that round out top 5 are Bank of America, Coca Cola, Wells Fargo and AmEx

Keith's Trading & Investing Plan - 8/6/20

1 - Sit tight. The market appears to be skittish so there's no statistical edge either direction short-term
2 - Prepare to buy $AAPL $MSFT if there's a break lower
3 - Study my charts

What'r your plans?

At it's multiple of 28x FCF that's about $420B.

So still a lot of value added, but maybe not all worth it.

Many see today's decline as concerning  I see it as a gift from the market 

Toughest part is mental  - nobody wants to buy when market is going down!

But the setup is there. $AAPL to $450 by end of Year! 

Define the risk and pull the trigger.

It's true that $AAPL has a nice historical FCF per share growth, 98th percentile in our universe thanks to buybacks. Our DCF model has a required rate of return of only 4.6% for this truly great company. That's a $265 price per share target. Problem is, that's 47% down from here.

I remember it like it was yesterday, 2y ago when $AAPL made history by hitting the trillion dollar market cap (most people underestimate how massive $1 trillion is). 

Fast forward only 2y later and we're at $2 trillion. This is fucking frightening. 

Mr FED, what have you done.

Nope. Here's what I got when I tested in SF on AT&T‚Äôs ‚Äúnationwide‚Äù 5G network:
5G: 32 Mbps
4G: 34 Mbps (say what?)

On T-Mobile:

Sort of...

If I kept that $464,200 in $AAPL it would be worth $940,192 today.

Instead, it's now worth $4,051,251 in $TSLA

That's $475,992 in gains with $AAPL vs $3,587,051 in gains with $TSLA. That's almost an order of magnitude difference.

Breaking: Apple lobbied Congress over China Uighur slave-labor bills. 

Did Apple lobby *for* the bills (which would piss off the country where it makes iPhones) or did Apple lobby against, which would piss off everyone else?

Under Bernie Sanders proposed financial transaction tax, a 1000 share trade on $AAPL would cost you $1,170 in taxes whether you win or lose on the trade. It‚Äôs not far fetched to imagine Biden taking up Bernie‚Äôs plan in my opinion. We all know Biden is their puppet at this point.

$AMZN, $TSLA, $AAPL are my 3 picks (obvious I guess).

My wildcard is $FB. They haven't exploded like I've hoped due to political issues, but oh well. Outside of what they're currently known for, I'm bullish on VR, Video E-commerce, sending money through Facebook services, etc.

I doubt we see a $10T company in our lifetimes. I think $AMZN gets to $5T over the next 10-15 years. They‚Äôll have the growth to keep the market cap moving higher whereas we‚Äôre already seeing growth at $AAPL starting to plateau although the iPhone upgrade cycle might change that.

An error I see traders make is they'll earn a nice profit in a familiar name like $AAPL or $AMZN, but will keep trading these stocks even after the charts have deteriorated.

Be open minded to the fact that your next big winner could come from a stock you've never heard of.

To isolate the impact of $AAPL‚Äôs share buyback, look at the diff between net income growth and EPS growth, which captures both the share reduction and interest on the debt taken on to buy back shares.  And that‚Äôs over 7 years!  Not 8 days.

$40k in those is worth ~$4 million today. The rest could have gone to $0 and you'd be just fine .com bubble and all

But if $AMZN fights the disruptors, it loses: see $SHOP (stopped competition in 2015), $ETSY, $AAPL (Fire phone), $NFLX etc. $TDOC is the disruptor here, so $AMZN will lose, imo.
