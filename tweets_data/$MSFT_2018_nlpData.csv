Today marks my 2nd year investing. The 3 I wish I was more patient with are $AAPL which I bought at $98 & sold for at $115. & both $C & $MSFT which I bought in the $40's & sold around $60's. Anyways I believe in the brightness of the future, so I don't regret the past.

My favorite tech play right now is $MSFT which is one of the top performers this year. $NVDA is another strong buy candidate. $CSCO another quality tech name plus I like the dividend. I still like $FB, it has fairly reasonable forward earnings/free cash flow multiple.

I heard the same for $MSFT in summer 2014. I was one of the few calling for $100 back then. Even regular guest Josh Brown on the CNBC lunchtime show makes the same point about a number of techs finally breaking above 2000 tech bubble levels.

A lot of equities have done similar moves, what is different about BTC is it was traded/priced on the market from the beginning. Image if you tracked $goog, $msft, $amzn  equity pricing from the pre-IPO phase garage stage. Would appear parabolic too.

$MSFT has massive lock-in with businesses, is massively cashflow-generative, and has finally killed off the windows-first culture that was holding it back from pursuing new opportunities. As always, I have concerns abt. valuation, but otherwise it’s not going anywhere.

But those you call “maximalists” just find interest in sound money and the revolution it brings. They don’t care about $TRX, just like they don’t care about $MSFT.

Amazing. Salesforce 5-year revenue growth is 4X  that of its nearest competitors, ⁦@SAP⁩ (7.7%) & ⁦@Microsoft⁩ (7.2%)—& well ahead of the giant in the field, ⁦@Oracle⁩ , which has grown revenues at a 1.4% pace over these past 5 years.

Never ever ever forget the words of Micro$oft's Steve Balmer. Now, this same company is incorporating the ""Hippie Garbage"" Bash shell into Windows. The analogy to Bitcoin is 1:1 Banks are Micro$oft, Bitcoin is Linux. The same lies and evil in each case.  https://theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/…

it's relative growth expectations. People must go long some stocks and short/sell some other stocks. They choose to go long $AMZN and $MSFT, etc. and short or sell $IP and others Beyond that it's hard to find causality.

$FB and $MSFT also have similar/competing products to Slack with Messenger/Workplace and Lync/Skype/Teams and would likely cannibalize or integrate. $AAPL is interesting but isn't playing in Enterprise space. $AMZN gives

It’s a good point, Walt. They could certainly be a suitor, but it feels like a more natural fit for either $MSFT or $FB. Then again, I never thought $AMZN would steal Twitch from the outstretched hands of $GOOGL either.

$AAPL worth about 15% of my portfolio, that's more than enough!

A definitive contract for approximately 34,000 of these stores is estimated in the next five business days. Roll-out should begin in January and ramp up significantly in month three. #SURG 2019
