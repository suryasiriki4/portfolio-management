Although $SHAK will pullback here I would be a long term buyer. I would SHORT $MCD. Shack is a more innovative company long term - with food and tech. $MCD will be replaced. They have a terrible product. $MCD would have to revert back to their 50s business model. NEVER happen.

Bam! $MCD continues to up their game as a drink run / coffee destination.  New Cold Brew Coffee & Frappe product hit the restaurants this weekend. Instead of pickle juice or cotton candy flavors like our competitors, this will be big this summer.

But Howard - there’s no complexity here. That’s the beauty of it. Instead of pushing the Mocha/Caramel Frappe button you push Cold Brew. The machine is fully automated to make the drink. If it was an espresso based drink, I would concur with you but it’s not.

Subway
Jack in the Box
Tim Hortons

Also, don’t forget the Applebee’s franchisee lawsuit and Dickey’s mass terminations and closures.

Burger King’s simple, yet genius idea to allow people to order a Whopper for 1 cent from their app, IF near a McDonald’s (the McDonald’s bit getting them the earned media and reach) has taken their app from 400 and something, to number 1 on the US App Store. Creativity matters.

The $MCD franchise (NOA) group is organized and respected that it will likely cost  senior management jobs in 2019.  Hard to see how the President of MCD USA survives.  How can a senior exec with zero experience tell a second or third generation franchises how to run a store?

The only reason why the stock market is not down 30% (like $AAPL) is the fact that a lot money has been hiding in defensive stocks like $MCD, $SBUX  and $CLX, which are actually up for the year! Don’t worry, they will now catch up to the rest of the market on the downside.

Coffee is the only point that I agree on with you.  They may be remodeling, but I’ve never seen that as a traffic driver. Remodels just sustain. New chicken just replaced old chicken, no driver there. Tenders are an old product.  Give me the $MCD that invented the McNugget
