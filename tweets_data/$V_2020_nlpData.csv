V + MA = almost a trillion.
$SQ = ~30 bn

Until shorts can prove beyond reasonable doubt that endpoint is not possible, they’re looking at a very rough ride.

I’d argue the opportunity for Square is bigger than $V

Square’s story very similar to $LUV & Enterprise Holdings

The FANG stocks ($FB, $AAPL, $GOOGL & $AMZN) $V & $MA are a given every year and I'll explain in the detailed analysis.

I was going to comment almost the same. They are the infrastructure for us to pay for goods and services. With $V or $MA we don't have the network to process our plastic in our pockets. When I first signed up to take credit cards in my business $V/$MA is a package deal.

If you can catch those sorts of inflection points, a commodity company that has just shed huge costs and has huge operating leverage will almost ALWAYS outperform $V or $MA over the short term. The trouble is looking 5 or 10 years out, they can't keep it going.

Over such a short time frame not really. Commodity names beat $V and $MA all the time, especially if they start at like 1x or 2x forward EBITDA  and coal prices double from late 2016 to 2018. 

I think the other names deserve criticism as much as $HCC deserves praise.

The Plaid purchase is definitely not a black-and-white issue. :-) Most acquisitions involve some element of overpaying, Plaid no doubt had other suitors anyway. $V up 250% since I bought in May 2014, (S&P up 68%). With that performance, I'd say Visa Plaid me at hello.

My thoughts on $V: anything under $200 per share and very attractive down near $180 (200d ma).

As for $MA: anything below $300 per share and more attractive near $280 (200d ma).

Both companies are cash cows.

It is like $V just had a qrt that the market expected more from, it was at a $204 high now at $200, I will buy more. In business a qrt is nothing (unless material changes). I hope my stocks have bad qtrs to buy more.

Great question. I think $PYPL would be better to run a ""private coin"" network (and still is), but they would be harder pressed to gain the participation of $V, $MA and others. FB's asset was their active user base (2.37B - includes whatsapp) vs Paypal (305M)

$Pags seems to be about a year ahead of $STNE in terms of growth metrics.

Less keen on looming competition between the two in the micro merchant biz

Could be a $ma vs $v type scenario I guess. Hopefully a long runway for both

$AAPL repriced from growth to value play a few years ago. A solid 50% slide and an ugly outlook at the time. We all know how that panned out. We are riding it out. $V & $SQ are our bets. However, this information is great to know. Thank you

Feel that. We added $AAPL & $MSFT to the portfolio. Bought more $BAC, $MU, $SQ $V $MO to it. Have $SPY straddle from here. We are looking for reentry into hedge, but think a snap back is very possible these next couple days. We have ISM data Friday, which just showed a turnaround

 that's just the dividend payout. $V stock rose 42% in 2019.  The combination of dividend growth and appreciating stock price make it a worthwhile investment.

I'm like Danny. I don't use leverage or options (though I believe both can probably be beneficial if done responsibly).

I stick with what I know.

Partly because I would rather wait to see, for instance, if $MA or $V or $DIS fall more.

Partly b/c is I'm just chicken!

Agree to a point, but point 3 cannot be used to justify buy at any price.  Your tweet had impact on me as I have been wrestling with $V and $MA and determining if I can justify buying at current valuations

Excluding $V (because I have held it for years), the other 10 stocks are down 6.81% from purchase.

Please note that 7 of the 10 have been bought since December, 5 of them in 2020 and 3 of them in February.

$AMRN is down 41% & $ROKU is down 23%

Plenty have tried. So far all have failed. Banks have tried (e.g. Chase Pay). Merchants have tried (e.g CurrentC/MCX). But the networks effects of $MA and $V are incredibly strong, I can't imagine a stronger economic moat or a harder business to break into. But it ""could"" happen.

. It's not the cards, it's the payment networks that $MA and $V operate. Nearly every major app in developed economies runs on these rails (e.g. PayPal, Cash App, Apple Pay, etc)

Ah I see. However I would like to dig a little deeper, meaning: We have experienced the phenomena of “taking out the middle man“ in various industries through digital business models. So couldn't that also happen to $V and $MA as they are the middle man for processing payments?

2/ For $IPAY, this is probably a very nice entry point for patient investors w/ a long-term mindset.

For investors looking at individual equities, make sure to be cautious around which of these companies are exposed to debt (e.g. $AXP) and which are not (e.g. $MA, $V).

Corporate philosophies differ. Some use debt judiciously. Others don't.

$V and $MA are so ridiculously profitable (after-tax profit margin 52%/48%) that big loss of sales likely won't dip them into red. $DIS is another story.

I own all 3 and have no liquidity concerns.

Puru Saxena
@saxena_puru
 · 24 Mar 2020
$FB trading < 1 PEG and $GOOGL ~1.25 PEG! 

$MA $VA trading ~1.6 PEG

They could go lower in the near-term but likely to generate strong returns over the next 3-5 years. 

My 2 cents, not investment advice.

Yes true for both $V and $MA. No credit risk. They're essentially a technology company, a toll booth with essentially an unlimited runway for growth. Doesn't get better than that

ERP is lower long term for highest quality cos, because you know you can raise money lower for longer. 

It’s a fair debate and broadly I agree that ERP “curve” should steepen significantly. Unfortunately, $V is at the bottom end of that curve

By the way, I have a confession to make. *deep breath*

I had my eyes on $V for a VERY VERY LONG TIME. When the price dropped, I bought the dip.

It was my first ""quality"",  Mungeresque purchase ever (I think?). 

Sh*t buying value investors these days... They grow up fast so.

Between $V and $MA update fair to assume 2H March is running -12 to -15% y/y. Extrapolated for all of CQ2, still reasonable to expect $V total revenue growth to be -Low to MSD for the year. Late Q2 trends/recovery matters far more. Long both.

I’ve never really understood what’s to love about this business.

They serve a nice little niche but I’m unsure how scalable it is from here.

I've mulled over it a bit. In what world is $V or $MA not making money? Even in corona shutdown, I would imagine they are the most resilient businesses.

It's the best moat business I can imagine - perhaps $GOOG is the only rival.

Correct

But

A team of tech companies didn't get together, create $ZM, and then pay to use it. 

That's literally what happened w/ $MA, $V, $VRSK, and $MKTX

Yeah I have to agree. Going to buy 25K chunks weekly of  $VUG for the next 6 mo. Get $800K invested in growth stocks like $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $V etc. I'm going to buy $NVDA on the side that's going to $350 and $TSLA that's going to $7000. Leaves $100K to daytrade long or short.

Agreed. I highlighted all 3, bc $V and $MA due to being loved by the “compounders, bro!” investor base, have cheaper vol in put options and less short interest. All 3 inc’l $SQ should crack big over the coming weeks.

Yeah ... i was looking for a fund — I know funds are horrible — but one with a low fee (Vanguard) that I could start setting aside and found $VUG — it has nice mix — $V $MC $HD $MSFT $GOOG/L $AAPL $AMZN I all like — at DOW 15K. Grab $VZ or $T, $TSLA $NVDA and even $AXP. Research.

$USO is a personal favorite right now. 

Also like the blue chips you mentioned + $V. 

Could sell puts on the way up for these, too. Especially since you can feel a sense of comfort getting in at these prices. Might as well take a couple % a week with so much upside left.

2/ However, I do believe $MA is the superior investment. The market seems to agree as Mastercard has out-gained Visa over the trailing 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods.

4) More drastic -20%-ish decline in cross-border in March is more worrisome. Comparing to GFC, worst quarter for V was Q2’09 down -8% (ex Europe). Much more lucrative and higher yielding than a domestic transaction, cross border has outsized impact on V/MA’s revenue

I love $V. It's in there (FinTech section). Personally I'm not keen on the Investment Banking business model, but could take a position in a company like $GS based on Valuation. Buying it during Bear Mkts (if Quality/Safety/Growth are still there) but selling it during good Mkts.

I think it also depends on the stock-for example $V has a low div but high growth so most of return is cap gain-better for TFSA. Compared to say $ABBV which has a higher div so less cap gain-better for RRSP

If you open a shoe store and you want to make sure you’re selling plenty of the Nike‘s that just dropped and are $150, that’s when you turn to $AXP, because their card holders can afford to spend large.

Well, there are some exceptions, but most of the pseudo-types can be inferred from simple checks - e.g is_numeric($v) && is_string($v) implies $v is a numeric-string. The basic idea: is the pseudo-type commonly implied from runtime value checks in large PHP projects?

It's a levered business against $V $MA, etc. and the moat seems diminishing as Loyalty Programs are a huge part of profits. How long when loyalty is not even important here? Network effect is less viral/dense compared with $PYPL / $SQ?

Thanks @InvWinchester I'd not read too much into this specifically for $V and $MA (both my holdings). I see an excellent opportunity for them, especially in countries (e.g. India) where people predominantly use cash and are transitioning to using more and more credit cards.

I really wonder how companies like $V, $MA and $AFTPF will fare in the next few years. People will have to rack up credit card debt like never before, which should help them. However, more people will default on payments as well. I wonder if any of your followers have insight.

Name a company with a Free Cash Flow margin greater than 30%.

[Free Cash Flow is the cash generated by a business after it pays all of its operating & capital costs, including those for future growth.

A 30% FCF margin is insanely high. It means the company is swimming in cash.]

By the way, I have a confession to make. *deep breath*

I had my eyes on $V for a VERY VERY LONG TIME. When the price dropped, I bought the dip.

It was my first ""quality"",  Mungeresque purchase ever (I think?). 

Sh*t buying value investors these days... They grow up fast so.

That is true, I own $MA instead of $PYPL for that reason, but $PYPL is way better positioned for this crisis and frankly was better positioned as an online only pureplay, whereas $V $MA are crossover plays.

Yea man. We dumped $MSFT at 178. $V as 177. Most of these companies are telling us that their quarters are going to be affected and they keep buying. Like $TSLA being at 8% over the price that Musk said was too high. We will should have a meaningful pullback when it comes.

Polen Capital's 5 guardrails for investing:

1) Rock-solid balance sheet
2) Sustainable ROE above 20%
3) Excess free cash flow every year, not just in good years
4) Stable to improving margins
5) Real organic rev growth, better than industry cycle

Did it?! Aw man thats annoying. I shorted $V with a perfect entry at 194.4 yesterday and covered at 192.75. It closed 189.24 so the feeling is familiar.
 Still, u cant be too upset about a winning trade.

Agree Chris on verb and go-to for very strong intangibles - how much I have missed on the gains for selling way too early because they were overvalued at one point!

$LYFT not global though unlike $UBER? That’s key difference to $V & $MA? Moat for rides < cards imo

Won’t get rich quick but I like $MO and $T for quality dividends and much room for appreciation. Also $AAPL $MSFT can do no wrong. My best performers over the past years are $V $MA and $AAPL they are priced pretty fairly right now tho

Depends on how much he is looking to invest - I would check out $SQ $V $FB as their price points are a bit more ""affordable"". ETF such as $VIG, $VTI or $VHT are also good investment as they are pretty stable, IMO

$V is one that I would recommend

- significant margins
- consumer credit card market is only growing 
- strong player in digital marketplace 
- benefits for the network effect 

It’s a long-term hold (+20yrs) in my portfolio that I am always looking to add at attractive values

Definitely both offensive and defensive, as you mentioned. Aside from V Europe ($20B+), $5B for Plaid is V’s biggest acquisition by far (CYBS was only $2B).  Will be interesting to see how, and if, $V is able to execute on this vision after the deal closes later this year

If you know of any value names in that space I would love to hear your thoughts

That's where the highest % returns live, but you can still be super ""late"" and make a lot of money.

MasterCard have travel insurance included in most of their offers, if I'm not wrong.
Not sure if Visa has the same amount of exposure in this area.

Oh same for me with $V, always seems too high

But unless people start using mobile payments en masse (like they do in some African countries like Kenya), I feel very good about the prospects of $V and $MA. 

With contactless cards it's more convenient than ever to use them.

Also $V and $MA have had a Total Shareholder return in the 35% range over the last 5 years which is outstanding.

For example, if you have a company and were offered $V for 20x earnings, you should do that acquisition! But headline ROIC in year 1 will only be 5% (or less with goodwill amortization)! If you just look at ROIC you’re effectively just looking at the P/E of the purchase.

Own both $MA and $V and they are about fairly priced now ihmo. These are not firms one should use shortcut valuation metrics such as P/S or EV/EBITDA to assess expensiveness. People have been saying expensive for years yet the firms grow. Valuation is easy yet so hard.

$SBUX, $V, $UNH grew their dividend ~20%/yr over the last 4 years. Trying to see which one, can keep being longer a 20%er. Looking at EPS vs div growth and TTM payout ratio it seems justified the lower yield $V as premium over $UNH over $SBUX . any agrees $V to be 20%er longer?

This is so true. It even exists with two exceptional companies. I opted fo buy $V over $MA and while $V is a great company and has performed very well i would have been better off buying $MA.

Not if you hold long term 5, 10 or more years great businesses that grow, prosper and win big. “Stock operators” are not long term business focused investors so avoid them and go long on excellence like:

You can argue that Visa $V and Mastercard $MA have been popular since they listed in 2008 and 2006 respectively.  High valuation multiples, well owned etc.  This hasn't stopped them being outstanding investments since then.  The market was right that they would deliver the goods.

If you don't mind me asking, what is/are your reason(s) for buying/holding $AXP? I purchased in April but sold last week due to concerns over travel and leisure spend. I see $AXP as a company with a larger cyclical factor than, say, $V or $MA.

possible, but the 190-196 range seems to be where all the buying and selling is.  Once it dries up it will move one direction or the other.  Watch the RSI down trend to break.  I think with bank earnings we see that spending is up and it bumps up the payment stocks $V $MC $AXP

It’s definitely put a dent. I’ve long invested in a set of stocks in my portfolio I’ve deemed as ‘War On Cash’. ($SQ, $PYPL, $V) and they’ve done exceptionally well. Especially during this pandemic where many business have had to adapt. The opportunity and TAM is huge!

$335 for $M

$215 for $V

The way I do PT is adding the difference between the recent range (high and low) to the breakout spot. 

Ex: $V has been in a range of $200 and $185. That's a $15 range. 

$15 + $200 (spot of breakout) = $215 first target

I don't think it matters if you buy $V at $180 or $195/share in the grand scheme of things

If it earns $20/share in 2030, sells for $400/share and pays a $10 dividend you should be ok at either price

If bitcoin obliterates it to extinction, your loss is still 100%

 knows banks pretty well, I believe she’s using $JPM as best of breed, should do well if banks recover and $WFC as the more aggressive beta position. 

I’m staying clear of all financials unless it’s pure fintech in which case I like $V and $SQ the most.

I am owning all of them except the builder stocks.  Don't underestimate the growth of $V.  Small dividend but growing fast.  The reason for its small dividend because the stock went up fast in the past 5 years.

Ke is not 5% Also intellectually you should probably do your ERP over corporate credit spreads rather than a larger number over RFR, even if you get the same result. You're also short some pretty existential puts with $V. Even if they're way too rich, in the event they go ITM =$0

Thanks for this $V alert, Ripster! I grabbed Sept. $220 calls w/ intention to hold, but trailing stop hit while I was working, and exited +8% (from a high of +18%). That stop saved me from going green to red. (-37% on the market dump was the low!) Scalped $QQQ puts after $V exit.

I personally don't own $V or $MA due to some discomforts about biz, but wish I did 5 years ago. The way this market will trade is high quality cos will be bid to perfection until fundamentals start wobbling, at that point the name will be taken out behind the shed and shot.

Yes,but COE includes Rf rate, Beta for $V ~1 or below, and I'd argue compression in credit spreads, which usually occurs when rates are hyper low & CB are stimulating leads to lower forward return expectations. With negative real rates defensive names gain bond-like qualities imo

I've owned $V for more than 10 years and it's up 10x.

Our L'Oreal shares are up 10x over 10+ years

It takes time.

I think $SQ could be a 100x candidate.

Many others exist.

It doesn't have to be 100x - just need a few home runs.

$LVGO was a 5x in 7 months. $TDOC?

No one can pinpoint a single 100x stock. That's why one buys & owns a portfolio.

I suspect a few of my current holdings are candidates to become 100x stocks over the next 2 decades.

I have holdings dating back more than a decade such as $V and L'Oreal and others are newer.

Really interesting question!

With $V margins 10% revenue growth translates into more cash flow than 20% of $SQ.

$SQ has more upside in its TAM though which makes me vote for $SQ.

IMHO, $v is not great for options if you are buying shorter dated ones. $v is best to go ITM/ATM with monthly+ expiry... or straight up go commons. It is a slow mover.
I am also part on the receiving end since i have 210sept which are just been breakeven through this $4 hike.

You can start with a dividend ETF and then start layering in some high-yield dividends like $T and $MO and then mix in some dividend growth stocks such as $V, $SBUX and $HD. Those are some of my favorites. Also take a look at REITs, which are a total return investment.

Yeah, they have also never felt like $AAPL or $TSLA in terms of branding, user experience, etc. They still feel like a cable/phone company vs. a tech company. Not premium feeling at all. $TMUS, on the other hand, feels way more similar to $AAPL and $TSLA than it does to $V.

Definitely. 

Shopify has way more penetration.  Have built many ecommerce sites the past 7 years.  Most were Shopify - customers are usually on $SHOP already.  Never had anyone ask about $BIGC, it's not in the conversation. 

Nothing like $V vs $MA, $SHOP increasingly dominates.

You should take a look at all of them and see what best fits your goals.

If you’re able to wait and experience more dividend growth $V & $MA are very strong

I’d put $V $MA and $PYPL in the same group. Great companies that will probably grow 15% per year assuming the digital/online economy continues growing. I like $SQ more than all of them but $SQ will be more volatile.

Do you think $MA and $V also fit into that slow growth category?  They seem like they’ve only come up 20-30% since the March lows. Seem like slow growers. Might be better to move them into the ones that did great but just got a haircut from sell off

tech was crazy too since /NQ was getting hit. $MSFT was over 7$ on a 20 delta at one point. $V was at close to 2$ on a 12 delta at one moment. Wild. I just didn’t want to add calls today and get whipsawed on Tues because this was just a long weekend and everything was extended

$V and $MA are fintech companies.  They make money by processing transactions.  No risk in credit loss; however $AXP is a credit card company. They are linked to credit loss.  With dividend yield at 1.63%.  it is a bit low for financial company with potential of loan loss.

To be fair, I haven't looked deeply enough into $V and $MA to know how much they're moving up the stack in value provided to justify the price. I'm guessing $V kinda threw its R&D budget into Plaid cause I don't see much innovation on the main brand

I like those suggestions. Adding some dividend growth would be beneficial in $AVGO and the defense sector is undervalued so $LMT $GD and $RTX are all in play. $HD or $V on a pullback would be solid additions.

$PYPL has done a couple smart deals over the years like Braintree and Venmo - just nothing recent.

Same here, long both names. Both have good growth potential in the next few years and opening new streams of recurring revenues and will do fine over the long term. I view both of them like twin stocks similar to $MA $V and there is nothing wrong in owning both of them.

It intuitively makes sense that the likes of $SHW, $SPGI, $V, $ROP, $HRL would do very well over time, as long as they maintain the rates of growth

Look at the 10yr chart and relax. Square for example uses the visa MasterCard network. $V or $MA are out perform candidates and diversifies $AAPL $MSFT $INTC $CSCO $TXN $QCOM it’s FINTECH not software devices and chips.

It’s much easier to have strong hands in times like this past March when you own great businesses like $BRK, $V, and $LVMUY rather than own a more abstract macro product like an ETF where you have an inclination to try and time it and become your own worst enemy. Just my $.02

Best method in my opinion 

Is keeping around 25%-50% into $QQQ and $VOO

Then with the rest focus on investing in companies that are low yield and still growing. Like $MSFT $V $AAPL $MA 

The ones that yield 1-3% and grow it every year are solid as well. Like $JNJ $PEP & $LMT.

From 2013 to 2019 I put every dime of investing capital into $V. Only Visa. I understand the risk of position sizing and I agree with you. But sometimes if done correctly concentration pays IMHO. I am now more diversified to try and keep that wealth. I’m most likely foolish

I have a good amount of my account in the market. Waiting for a few to finish up. I would have entered $V and $PYPL this week for sure. If $PYPL dips again tomorrow it might be too enticing to pass on.

I’m excited to see how $STNE will stand the competition from companies within payments ( $V $MA), e-commerce ( $MELI, $SE & $AMZN), and social media ( $FB). The competition is really intensifying in Latin America.

It depends. I used to think on same lines, but you also have to consider opportunity cost. 

Owning $MA and $V as set it and forget it stocks is fine, but would you have done better if you invested in $SQ and $PYPL instead? 

The latter have significantly outperformed the former.

Yeah. My basic rules back then were things like a cheap PE ratio (LOL), little to no debt, etc so I could buy it and not worry about it while deployed. Proved to be my best winners. $APPL in ‘07 and $V in ‘10. I need to remember that formula again.

Looking good Lanny. So close to $16k total and $10k in taxable. Any thoughts on what you will do with $MAT, $DAL and $BBBY? You could consolidate into a position in $MA where the yield is currently near 0 but likely to grow. It would be comparable to your $V position size too.

I dont believe you need to know *all* of your holdings. I hold both $V and $MA and I don't feel the need to follow everything they do. Have a glance at earnings, and pay attention to big headlines, but other than that they are buy and hold stocks so happy to set and forget.

Those less than 1% dividend yield actually are very good dividend companies.  $AAPL $MSFT and $V are best dividend growth stock.  Check

$MO pretty big earnings declines and the government makes risk unpalatable

I agree with you guys about balance.
high yield is already there, but a high growth can be good in the long run (+share appreciation usually).

If you check the console, the value is being set. You can check with $v('PAGE_ITEM_NAME'). The value will be there, but the display is not. A quick solution is using:

apex.item('PAGE_ITEM_NAME').setValue(pValue,pDisplayValue);

pDisplayValue setst the display value

My thesis that news follows price and nothing else matters. Election, COVID, etc...

October brings new ATH's, maybe more than 1.
No matter who wins election we will be trading in a range.
Next large sell off is week of Thanksgiving.

Or I could be totally wrong. Time will tell.

Starting yield? 

Anything above 0.5% depending on the dividend growth rate

I'd rather not miss out on high (dividend) growth opportunities like $V, $MA, or $MSFT

High current yield is tempting but it has to be sustainable

Surprised no one has picked $ROKU

I love $AMZN & $AAPL but are they really going to double again in the next couple years? $CRWD a close second for me. 

Going with $V (tuff choice) and $T for the other two.

That's also why it's not correct to say Alipay and Tenpay disrupted $V / $MA.

IIRC 
@BluegrassCap
 specifically likes $V over $MA.

I think the thesis is that $V can reinvest more and/or at higher ROIC.

Probably related to ""building rails"" / ACH  -- Visa Europe?

I'm not an expert here

$V CFO described its differences from $MA:
1. V not interested in business of ""building rails"" in payment (they won't own it and access will be open to all) 
2. V believes it can do B2B better and is 1.5x larger

That’s fair. $MA has had a nice run against $V since 2016. Probably various factors like currency coming into play. I’ve always felt $MA has better topline potential (low mid teens) compared to $V (struggles to get to 10%) and hence should do better over time.

When someone asks me what’s the one stock I should I buy, I say $SQ 

Market caps:
$SQ $75.2B
$PYPL $225.3B (SnP Nas 100)
$V $428.7B (SnP 500)
$MA 339.2B (SnP 500)

There is a ton of room for this stock to grow; bc it’s not in $SPX it won’t get knocked on big index drawdown days

It seems to be nice but they charge hefty fee for withdraw own money. Why instead of $V or $MA cards we can't use #QR Code to proceed with payments. I tought that's whole point of the crypto to be more independent and removed intermediary.

Macro is great. It's easy to reference variable via $v{someVar}, but I can't find how to reference expression, so I have to construct AST by hand via API like callX.
Also, $v{} method can not be found if it is in closure/lambda, e.g. macro { where(n -> $v{someVar}) }

In an April filing, Paul Pelosi bought $3.3M in $MSFT, $GOOG and $WORK. Other big investments include $CRM, $FB, $AAPL and $V. So maybe nothing, but this isn’t exactly a large cap FAANG.

When your product becomes more useful the more people use it. The stronger your moat becomes.

Thanks.

I don't think $V or $MA would be interested in outright ownership of this asset (although I am only reading about it for the first time today..!) And generally I don't think the networks will compete too much with Stripes of the world. Very different strategies.

High yield dividends stocks I like:

Dividend growth stocks I like:
$V $PEP $ABBV $AVGO $AFL

Safe dividends:
$JNJ $MMM $WM $KO $PG

Or if you’re not ready for individual stocks, invest in dividend ETF’s

The greatest moat-affirming insight was that tech usually wins via unprecedented scale. And they tried wrt credit cards but $V & $MA already had global ubiquitous scale: they ARE big tech. ApplePay, GPay, etc all took the knee.

The biggest inefficiency in payments is how many steps there are between a vendor and the consumer’s actual funds.  It seems to me that the greatest disruption would be a decentralization away from $V and $MA and cuts out the middleman.  Could be #crypto, but it needs to evolve.

$v doesn’t make money off Interest payments, since thats not who you’re borrowing money from. Visa make money off of transaction fees (this is a better business model). You’re borrowing money from chase, captial one, etc. That’s who collects the interest.

Bought $MA in Mar drop and $V during last month volatility. Even though $V was bought at higher validation. I think these are the so called blue chips which will win in the long term.

1,463 shares of $AAPL to cover a $1,200 iPhone. (Years worth of dividends)

479 shares of $V to cover a $100 per month phone bill for a year.

So if you want to start today, it’ll cost you roughly $190k up front.

Been debating if I should add  $PYPL (since so many ppl use venmo) or even $V (Hard to classify this one-old tech?new tech?) if $SQ is a big holding already. Just very long fintech overall. An example is nobody uses cash/card anymore in . That will happen in North America too

I’ve looked at $V and it’s a strong company with great margins but growth is slowing. I’d rather own $SQ because I think it has more upside over the next 2-3 years.

They all have 50%-80% drawdowns.

Most don't hold and most don't get the 30,000% long term gain.

Point being, $V and $MA likely to provide market beating gains next decade as well.

$V is a prime candidate for disruption. Disruption means taking out the middle men who take a cut. Digital fiat currency is coming as is already live (beta) in the Eastern Caribbean. Also bitcoin may play a role.

2nd chart- (Daily) -- 20SMA sits at .011 

Two areas to focus .0095-.011+ for breakout.

Interesting thought. But wouldn't the optimal solution be very high initial investments, building the network etc. and very low marginal costs per new user? That creates high barrier of entry but ensures high gross margins in the future. For example $V and $MA and maybe $NFLX.

I lean a bit more on dividend growth stocks 

Own a lot of $MSFT $V $MA $LMT $AAPL $ABBV $WMT 

I also have large positions in $DIS $FB and $AMZN

Would consider $V. Not for dividends though. Dividend stocks do not provide the rate of growth I am looking for.

For my diversification stocks I decide to go with “best in class” I think $JPM and $V fit the bill when it comes to financials. BAC is not a bad choice either. I am also dabbing a little 3X FAS (financial etf) to capture the eventual “real” covid bounce

It’s a payment company. It just doesn’t yet own fintech technology. It’s a huge part of the Stripe business, which probably should have made the list. Of course, all live on margins offered by $WFC, $V, and $MC....

While the three that @7AustinL listed above are some of my highest conviction holdings, I believe that $MA, $V, and $PYPL also have an excellent chance at hitting the one trillion dollar mark soon.

I was a member of black box for a month. But I don’t know how to use the data. So I came out. Here I follow your tweets and learn few things. This is helpful. For $V, does this shows there is a strong support ? What is the pattern here? Can you provide more light on this ?

Agree with most but I’m not so sure about $JPM or $V.

I would choose dividend ""growth"" stocks as long as they're future-proof (e.g. $MSFT, $AAPL, $V, $JNJ, $BMY or $ABBV, while avoiding banks, oil, gas, ...) and then enjoy financial freedom or reinvest dividends into growth stocks to spice up the portfolio.  #Stocks #StockMarket

“Why would I invest in my 10th-best idea? 20th? 30th?”

The NFL draft answer:

In his year, Russell Wilson was the 75th-best idea…

Patrick Mahomes was the 10th...

Lamar Jackson was the 32nd...

Aaron Rodgers was the 24th…

And Tom Brady was the 199th-best idea.

You can't just set these next to each other,. Growth and margins also count. $V and $MA have a profit margin of around 45%, gros margins of around 80%. $TSLA has profit margin of 1.9% and gross margin of 21%. If $SHOP grows just 40% next year, it's at 30. $ZM the same.

I think both $ADBE and $ADSK are great businesses, but I sold them for the same reason I don’t own $V and $MA, which is I think they’re more legacy moats than reinvestment moats. Nothing wrong with that but if they’re gonna return 15% a year I would rather just own more big tech.

Take rates are so different.

$V take rates are comparable with what it would cost a merchant to deposit cash in a bank.

$DASH take rates are so high that restaurants often have higher menu prices for doordash, and still realize a lower $ profit contribution vs. in-store sales.

Which I agree with and is not what I said. Just that history shows it rarely works - try applying a 50x or 100x multiple on $GOOG $FB $MA $V at IPO and see what returns you get... but maybe $DOCU $ZM & co. will turn out being much better businesses than these.

Good points on classification, it’s something #investors looking at SPDR sector #ETFs must look at. E.G., $V & $MA is actually held by $XLK (tech) whereas $AXP is under $XLF. & none of $AMZN $GOOGL $NFLX $FB are held by $XLK (first is $XLY, others are $XLC)

Likewise, I always have to double check that one in particular - no question $V harnesses tech to a great extent - as does virtually every firm nowadays - but for it not be classified as financial services (which I believe it had been in the past) strikes me as pretty nonsensical

If NASDAQ/NYSE are concerned, Since I noticed you have recommended for $FB.

$TSLA, $INTC, $NVDA, $NVDA, $MSFT, $V (Visa), $VZ (5G and Other Advancements) & $AMZN.

I have some more but I'm skipping them right now.

I'm bearish when it comes to $AAPL.

$MA & $V tend to move together like a school of fish. If $V has potential to $260 would that mean $MA can pull off a move to $400+ in a similar timeframe?

The decoded code is similar, including order of ops and variable names (eg $v), but I think the samples Kaspersky had also used camel-casing kind of like Empire Agent does.
