In general, $XOM is a lower volatility stock, that's had a lot of volatility recently w/ it's move from range high $89 to range low $75 in a straight line. IMHO nibbling some shares or selling OTM or ATM puts is a decent play. In a smaller account, can do as little as 1 contract.

Haven't seen it but I don't think $AMZN or other stock that hadn't previously paid dividend would tank if they declared that they wouldn't.

$XOM higher priced & been in a 15 point range for a year.
Felt $XOP had more meat on the bone - extended to downside and reversing towards a gap above.  Came up just short of my first target on Wednesday.

Like Melo, id say there are way better places to find value. They‚Äôve been calling $GE a value buy since $20, then $15, and now under $10 

If someone wants value buy I‚Äôd recommend $PFE $PG $JNJ $XOM $PEP $KO $CLX $MRK and many more before I got to $GE but that‚Äôs just me

My guess would be $XOM or $OXY. Maybe $JAG. Exxon wants more Texas Delaware exposure, so I could see them buying Halcon, Jagged Peak, or Contango since their acreage is all in the same neighborhood.

If you look at $XOM for example, they haven't really increased production in years. They're not in an M&A spree. All the announced spending is just to replace existing reserves. They discovered billions of barrels in Guyana, and the stock's flat over the past 5 years.

Interesting that $XOM rumored to be looking at Endeavor - one of the biggest/most mature private‚Äôs (w/o a lot of PE $$s if memory serves) along with $CVX. I think Endeavor is what the PE-backed co‚Äôs will need to aspire to if they want to see good exit valuations.

$SLB has taken a bit more hit than others in the industry such as $XOM. Going by history, seems like a long short trade is opening up.

Using swing rules on #MonthlyChart, we could be going to ~15$. Again, best is to let #StageAnalysis tell you when market has found a bottom.

Yep, don't buy if below or declining 30 week WMA, SMA or EMA! Knowing the higher trend is declining, you want to sell into strength. 57 is a possible support where it could consolidate, letting MA catch up, giving you a better risk to reward short entry. #StageAnalysis $xle $xom

Very far from even considering any long position. Until you have a ""green"" Mansfield Indicator (inclining 30 week SMA + close above 30 week SMA + outperforming $spx), nothing to see here. $xom $xle $cl_f
