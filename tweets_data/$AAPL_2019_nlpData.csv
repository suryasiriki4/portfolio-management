There's a common misconception $AAPL needs to have a cheaper lineup. The right way to look at Apple in China is as a luxury good. Cheapen the brand and it instantly loses its aspirational appeal / brand equity.  https://jingdaily.com/chinese-millionaires-gifts/?utm_source=Jing+Daily+Subscriber+List&utm_campaign=434ec91067-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_09_13_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8dec01cd8d-434ec91067-408010837‚Ä¶

@TMFJMo @TMFMathGuy @FoolMCochrane Seems like aside from Cash App's Boost, Apple Card does everything Square's consumer card does. Hugely built in user base. I view this as a negative for Square, despite imitation being best form of flattery. Thoughts? What am I missing?

The article you shared isn't even really about Apple, but a Microsoft advertorial (bc an Apple headline gets more traffic‚Ä¶ which speaks volumes).

Is it time for Tim Cook to go?
I've seen this question come up repeatedly as of late on Quora. The proposition has in fact been floated practically since the time of Steve Jobs' passing.

I can't belive it has not yet been acquired by $AAPL $MSFT $FB $AMZN $GOOG $BRK or the likes. It's too cheap compared to what it can become in 10 years.

How to become a billionaire in 2019
1.Go live in the EU
2.Go to an EU court and file a lawsuit against Apple saying that they have put invisible cameras in your home
3.Ask 100% of $AAPL as compensation 
4. As you‚Äôre in the EU you‚Äôll obviously win the court
5. You‚Äôre a billionaire

I remember when I was going to buy $AAPL at $14 but then got smart because I knew that shit was overvalued. They make desktop computers for graphic designers I said. They going to zero I said.

A quick note about the $tsla $aapl comparison. What bothers me most about it is that Jobs never told you what he was going to do, at least not in a showy way, he just did it. By the time he announced anything they were already manufacturing them. No hype. Just delivery.

Don't underestimate the negative impact of sky high valuations.

$MSFT and $AAPL went public at $1Bish valuations. 

That left plenty of room for investors to grow.

$UBER and $LYFT valuations remind me of Netscape IPO which signalled beginning of Dotcom crash.

And everyone seems ok with that.

25 Years Ago Today, Forrest Gump Debuts.

In the film, his Bubba Gump shrimp money is put into Apple.

Based on the timeline, Gump could've bought 3% of the company for about $100,000.

Today that's worth $28.1 billion, which would make him the 31st richest in the world today.

$SPY daily 200MA test. the last 2 times they defended it pretty well off the lows. What they do this time dictate my bias for the next few days. if strong close (long wick off daily lows) then good time to start looking for Calls on relative strength names. vice versa for puts.

Off by 3 zeros, Hedge. $46M per day, not $46,000.
If the tariffs are 15% of $112B, that = $16.8B
.15 x $112,000,000,000 = $16,800,000,000 per year
Divide that by 365, and you get $46,027,397.26, about $46M per day. I know, I know, ""Boring.""

$SQ and $DIS are expensive.  

My buy point for $DIS is $122.  

$SQ just watching.

I agree with you on $BA and $AAPL.  I like $BA but thinking of taking profits and buying it lower.

I like $AAPL below $200.

I am really cautious starting any new position.

With Apple Pay your face unlocks your phone & the phone makes the payment. 

In China (I think) the till recognises your face and uses that info to debit your bank account. 

The issue is: Who has your face data?

Not a fan of $AAPL as an investment, but I trust them on security.
