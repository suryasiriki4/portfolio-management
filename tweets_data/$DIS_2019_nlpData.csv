The mid terms are over baby, over.   40 seats lost by the GOP.   I don't deny that there are tosspots on both sides that try and rig the system, but the idea that voter fraud is the reason for the massive swing at mid-terms is not credible.

Interesting streaming wars shaping up with $DIS $T $AMZN, $CMCSA $HULU and $AAPL creating stiff competition for $NFLX. Let us wait and see if $NFLX will be better positioned to fight off rivals.

$NFLX is paying alot for original content and that is not sustainable long-term,  but I'm impressed by subscriber growth across the globe. Competition from rivals like $AAPL $DIS will be abig concern. Netflix has a good head start and that gives it a strong competitive advantage

Sujay, great hearing from you - I am intrigued with $DIS.  Only company with a chance of competing with $NFLX and $AMZN.  Very hard for co‚Äôs like $DIS to adapt to data driven mgmt by hypothesis with continuous a/b testing which is essential online.  But I think $DIS has a shot

$DIS just got a lot bigger this year, now streaming will make them even bigger. So yes, it will surely be bigger in 10 years. As for $AAPL, look at how fast their service business is growing.

Agreed.  Beauty, luxury and generally any brand that had an emotional resonance ($NKE, $LULU) rather than simply reducing search costs (many HPC brands). Curious to see how $DIS does - it isn't easy for co's like $DIS to manage by hypothesis and A/B tests.  But they have a shot.

The lack of appreciation for ‚Äòvalue capture, versus ‚Äòvalue creation‚Äô in $DIS is confounding.For years they allows the ecosystem of distribution to rent seek(eg theatres, home video retailers, Netflix). Now they will re-capture that value on a 1-to-1 relationship with its custome

Congratulations! My $DIS position is up 85% since I bought it but is still losing to the market. Hoping that changes this year with the move into streaming and one of the most impressive slates of upcoming movies that I can imagine.

I agree with both of you actually. There‚Äôs no way I don‚Äôt end up on both but I also think $DIS + $NFLX is a content marriage made in heaven. That said, NFLX doesn‚Äôt help DIS with ESPN. 

$T is screwed IMO.

This is a chart of the Dow at the same level as two previous peaks.  The trouble with trying to interpret it is that there are 30 stocks in the Dow.  Some are rising, others are falling, some are flat, some are trend reversing.  An average tells you nothing about the future.

That's exactly what I did except I went further out in my strikes. Heavily bought $DIS January 2020 $130 calls when it was around $128. Up about 100% so far with 8 months to go.

$DIS will be at $170 to $200 by the end of the year.

$DIS reports tomorrow after the bell.  I am expecting a beast on top & bottom line.  A move lower after the report.

$DIS has moved up substantially after their analysis day.  This was due to the streaming service coming out late 2019.  Watch for the ESPN sub numbers.

For context:

$AMZN trading at 30x Enterprise Value/EBITDA multiple

$NFLX trading at ~100x - so deal dilutive even before the premium $AMZN would need to pay

$DIS OTOH is trading at around 15x adjusted for recent Fox deal

Even with NFLX‚Äôs growth, seems overvalued vs. DIS now

Well I would say $NFLX is the more pure cord cutting play, but $DIS is much better value and their ownership of Hulu and ESPN could spell big trouble for cable companies. If $DIS added ESPN streaming to Hulu, it will be game over for $CMCSA.

I'm a big fan of long $ROKU + $DIS / short $CMCSA to capitalize on cord-cutting. $CMCSA, admittedly, is still a cash machine, but in terms of growth, it is going to lag $ROKU and $DIS due to being too entrenched in it's cable business.

In the case of $DIS, only on wk bar closed below $120 that's 10% of 10wma, but 14 or so Day bars out of the last 50...that's 28%...just a lot more weighting prior to the gap in the 50 day than 10wk...hence the huge difference...

Would like to say investing wisely is very important. Many people put in a mutual fund and don‚Äôt get a full benefit because fund managers charge fee even if it underperforms SP500. So best to invest your own by doing homework. For starters, I recommend $COST, $DIS, and $SPY.

- @RobertIger - seems best way to address content quotas in foreign is 70/30 partnerships with local content providers 
- ie go 70/30 on local production costs, and perhaps ~10% rev share on local market sub revenue - or tiered levels tied to local sub targets

Which you completely flagged. I don't doubt what she's saying happens. Bc I've worked retail and Disney throws gift cards at a lot of problems. 

It would take a lot of $105 scamming to make this a big chunk of Parks for $DIS. (Though would employees do it? Yes.)

$DIS is a ""bank"" for me.  When I make money in a riskier equity, I eventually move gains into $DIS, $VZ, or a broad market ETF.

When I want to raise cash or reinvest in riskier stocks, I withdraw from one of these places.  That's why I buy/sell in smaller amounts often.

So wrong. $DIS builds parks to add days to your vacation. They don't want to build something that a guest can look at and think, ""I don't like Star Wars, so I can skip that park and eliminate a day from my trip.""

No major operator is looking to build a single-IP, full-day park.

This is just a valuation comparison. $roku has a much cleaner model.  Love it. $dis move is very risky. It will go back to $110 level. $nflx plateaued but it will win the war in the end imo. $roku would get bought out at a very expensive price when the war intensifies. My guess:)

$SQ and $DIS are expensive.  

My buy point for $DIS is $122.  

$SQ just watching.

I agree with you on $BA and $AAPL.  I like $BA but thinking of taking profits and buying it lower.

I like $AAPL below $200.

I am really cautious starting any new position.

$DIS betting the long-term value creation of Disney+ is higher than selling rights to 3rd-parties.

If in 10 years DIS has 100M subs, if they raise DIS+ cost by $1-2/month, that‚Äôs great margin.

Otherwise you need to rely on NFLX continuing to pay high prices for your content.

You definitely have more patience then me hedge haha. It's been tough holding $DIS for weeks. But hanging in there know the company is undervalued. Have like 400 shares and bunch of Jan and March calls. Been selling calls and puts to offset losses while I wait.

Think more fundamentally: $NFLX is investing in expensive content in order to put it onto a platform that generates $0 in marginal spend (only value is reducing churn), rather than being like $DIS and generating massive revenue in theatres. How does that add value? Bad business.

Dips near 40$ have been a blessing, co. continues to give itself a runway in many areas. Still think $DIS should of purchased them instead of $Fox, better IP/their http://Battle.net ecosystem presentd plenty of synergies for savings and opportunities for new film franchises

Excellent piece. $NFLX will have to remain aggressive especially with subscriber growth now that rivals like $DIS $T and $AAPL have intensified competition. I'm betting on $DIS growing into the biggest competitor for Netflix. Disney+ is also cheaper at $6.99.

It'll also get interesting if/when DIS and others release their own datecdotes.

For instance, I could see $DIS touting that x% of Disney+ subs watched The Mandalorian. Well, then can we compare that to $NFLX? Is 26M of NFLX's 160M subs watching El Camino impressive? Maybe not

I'm intrigued to see what happens w/ ESPN. If we keep losing cable TV subs at an accelerating pace, some of their deals like MNF & NFL look really expensive and can $DIS continue demanding so much per sub?

My outside the box prediction is they sell ESPN to $T before it collapses

If Disney starts making poor movies or audiences tire, the company's profits will rapidly erode.

Disney's first Star Wars film made $780MM in profit. It's fourth, Solo, *lost* $80MM.

Dumbo lost $60MM, Nutcracker $70MM, BFG $100MM. https://matthewball.vc/all/marginalaffinity‚Ä¶

It gave up $2B after breaking up with $nflx. Carriage fees will go down cuz some contents are also available on $dis +. Not sure abt management's idea and exact math behind it. It's a bold move which could be good in long term. But it just feels very risky for a 260B company(2/2)
