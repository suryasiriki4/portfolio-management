Agreed...tough to know how $CVX is ascribing value. 

Permian was 23% of XTO’s ‘09 PV-10. Ironically, XTO expanded their Permian position in 04/05 “through acquisitions and trades with $CVX $XOM and others.” Assets tend to come full circle in energy - see $CXO & $RSPP!

I think I misread your question, thought you were asking about $XOP. You asked about $XOM, its higher quality than the smaller E&P's, so if earnings are good the safe money might move to Exxon and maybe push it up a few dollars, esp if it's better than $CVX, sorry for misreading!

Look at $CVX , is telling you that all strength has to be used for selling positions in $OIL. 
At 55 area is no way to break it through. In opposite case, it seems like would move towards 50 area and much lower too.
Seems like retesting 2016 lows on coming 3 to 6 months.

Definitely some truth in that. Energy is such a small sector these days that's it's easily moved by a relatively small amount of supply. I think it's maybe 5% of S&P (with $XOM $CVX making up half of that 5%). I think it's just a matter of some thinking WTI may have topped 60-61.

The only thing that makes it useful is that it's equal weighted. The top 10 holdings are weighted roughly the same as say holdings 30 through 40. Never understood the refiners in there though. It's either $XOP or the $XLE (which is about 42% $XOM and $CVX). Really not much choice

I like $XOM, definitely buying more, one of my favorite #oil stocks along with $CVX.  Both are great companies, with excellent balance sheets and margins.  I think CVX showed that they were fiscally responsible in their handling of the $APC merge.

The timing is perfect for $CVX to buy $CXO. $CVX left at the alter by $APC. Short term price dislocation with $CXO for some of the best shale in the Permian. $CVX has to be looking/talking to $CXO. There would be a nice premium from here. Everyone happy.

Exactly what I'm looking for. The only other thing concerning me right now is $CVX (and $XOM to a lesser extent). Chevron is still sitting in a spot where it could easily get rejected and take the sector down. I'll be a lot more bullish once that gets past 115-116.
