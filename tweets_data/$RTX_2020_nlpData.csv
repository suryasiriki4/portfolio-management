What is the price of the new company going to be?  

$132 ($UTX price) x  57% = $75.25 New company price

$185.90 ($RTN price) x 43%  = $79.93 (New company price)

2.3348 ($RTN) x $79.93 (New company $) = $186.83 ($RTN)

I think that‚Äôs the correct math.

$RTX I have calculated an estimate of Raytheon Technologies Market Cap post-merger. It is 75.7 Billion.

Based on 2019 Pro Forma Sales of 78 Billion and current share price of 49.93, that is a 0.97 Price/Sales Ratio!

there are lots of quality companies out there and things are constantly changing. Most recently i had shares of both United Technologies and Raytheon. 

They merged last week and the new ticker is $RTX. It should be a great dividend stock that will also miss the screeners.

I don't know if there is a right answer but 25k in $XCUR, 25K IN $CYCN, 25K in $TRIL and I can't decide between $RTX, $LMT or $NOC for the last 25 $LMT is the best company but the other two are undervalued.

Notice the $RTX video where he's picking out scrabble letters. He never shows the letters. My guess is that he has some very serious work being done behind the scenes. 

I think he's being advised and these are not just random picks.

Defense names like $RTX and $GD look intriguing as US/China tensions could rise as well as China/India tensions beginning to rise. Both pay solid dividends. 

Other high-quality dividend stocks worth a look include $ABBV and $AVGO.

Thanks for the input.  I was just watching it since you had mentioned it.  Held $90 support well and I thought it's prime for a move back towards $100+.  I dabbled in some further out (Aug) option calls.  Same with $RTX.  Nothing crazy, just want some skin in the game.

No. I have been an aerospace investor for a long time. I didn't buy airlines in the good times. I have never lost money in any aerospace trade up to this point and I don't intend to start losing money either. $LMT $NOC $RTX $HON best in sector. I would avoid suppliers right now

FWIW there's nothing in that EV space I'd want to invest in directly. All the ancillary powergrid stuff however:, charging, grid batteries, and electricity-as-a-modern-market is intriguing. I'd rather own $HON $RTX and the $GRID ETF, than $TSLA or any automaker.

Plenty of good ones out there to choose from.

$T under $30
$RTX under $60

$1K invested in each at current prices would pay you the following annual dividends:

Hey Craig, I am looking at calls for $RTX for just after earnings. Earnings are mid-week next week, and am interested in calls for next Friday, just after earnings. I think they are going to surprise and stock is going to pop. What are your thoughts? Interested? 63 to 65 calls

that's interesting.

in the case of $MAXR they need umbrella cover of a 'big brother' to execute on their initiatives. they can't remain perennially undercapitalized... 

$LMT $RTX should care, $NOC owns Orbital ATK... $BA unlikely as suitors

By comparison of the below Upwork because it's a better platform for enterprise use (Where the money is) 

Fiver is largely for quick fix one off jobs for the general public. 

$UPWK is the only one I see 10x.  I do see $RTX 3x but not for at least 5 years.

Defense. 60-78% $RTX in the portfolio

I'm an anti diversification kind of guy.  They ain't going nowhere. Dividend + Value stock, high defense revenue. 

Aviation issues from covid is why it's cheap. They are also an innovating tech company.

Hi Matt. Thanks for the reminder! I need to sell some more $RTX puts ... as for $PLTR, I hope it prices well and to buy but meantime I've fenced $SSSS ahead of time to gain pre-listing advantage. Hasn't moved a whole lot, though.

What's your take?

Very nice!  Any considerations to get diversify into defense stocks ( $LMT, $NOC, $HII, $RTX, $GD) or more REITs?  
Our dividend positions are: $LANDP, $KMI, $MMM, $JNJ & $CVS
I like using covered calls as my 'dividend' positions.  Higher taxes, but higher returns as well.

$RTX now has a lot of commercial areo exposure than previously due to merger with UTX. I'd swap $RTX with either $NOC or $LHX.

$RTX is kinda okay, but the dividend is too small.  Had it for a number of years, sold it all in Jan this year.

$PLTR will be like $BA $LMT $RTX. But with an option to offer more mainstream products.

It will definitly hold 15b$ valuation just because of it's gov connections, the brand and Thiel on the board.

But it might go to $7.5. So I am currently just watching and waiting.

Dollar cost average in. 

I would not be shocked if it dips more going into the end of the year.  Investors taking profits or closing their positions at year end.  

Then I would expect $RTX to move higher in January.  I would be ready for that scenario.  I am long term bullish.
