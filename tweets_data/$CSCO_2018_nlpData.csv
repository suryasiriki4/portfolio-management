There is fragmentation in the industry in term of number of vendors inside a single company. A single one (even big caps ones) can manage $FTNT $PANW $FEYE $CSCO and many more. This is also due to the legacy they have (aka if it works don't touch it).

My favorite tech play right now is $MSFT which is one of the top performers this year. $NVDA is another strong buy candidate. $CSCO another quality tech name plus I like the dividend. I still like $FB, it has fairly reasonable forward earnings/free cash flow multiple.

In the last 18 years duration has been huge factor. Buyers near the 2000 top had to wait until 2013 to see gain if they didn't reach uncle point. Investors in $CSCO still haven't. But the main issue is convexity and TIPS are more convex, right?

Intriguing chart setup like how $CSCO was on monthly/quarterly ... This to me is a longer term play. Having said that I need more info. Market cap etc. for fundies and what sector, overall sector performance to view etc. Price & volume alone - nope.

I don’t follow $CSCO too much to be honest, but it looks like it’s struggling ever since the gap down. 

$INTC on the other hand is day 1 of B/O, although for a longer term investment I would pick $NVDA. Just my 2 cents... and you are very welcome :)

Same here. Most people don’t really see options like I do. Here’s an example... last week on the $CSCO news when the stock got crushed... the $CSCO put went from $0.40 to $2.15 in about 25 minutes. There was an $FCX put in April that went from around $0.25 to $2.40. Crazy moves.

While I am not rushing out to be long $NFLX, I don't consider it a bubble like $CSCO.  Netflix is more like subscription based alcohol or drugs - they deliver the goods people want versus a capex product or service.  I see a lot of consolidation happening near $330.

I disagree. $CSCO had 16 quarters of triple-digit earnings; one of the strongest growth records in history before it topped. $AMGN and hundreds of others had huge earnings. There were more than 1000 companies with growth rates of 30%. The http://dot.com stocks had no EPS

@permabear_uk $CSCO technically strong into low $50s by end of year. Will be interesting to see if like $MSFT $INTC in the past 2 years, $CSCO can finally breakout out of its multi yr tight range into the $60-70s #investing #trading #technology #TomsTruths

Replying to @FordWealth, @michaelsantoli and @jessefelder
Can't make bets on the monopoly black swan. If you give $AMZN the same p/s ratio that $CSCO had at the top of the last bubble, it would have a market cap of $9 trillion.  Speculative blow off top yet to come.

$SPX is weak, $NASDAQ extremely weak! Staying away until i see more confirm movements. Usually, it would be about time to buy in a week or 2. BUT, recent movement is a little unusual. $NASDAQ is a little too flat, when it does, it might move lower.

well one thing, this ain't 1999, $CSCO traded at 40X+ Rev's if memory serves.  As much as I detest $AMZN it isn't remotely that overvalued a $GOOGL is arguably at ""Value stock"" level valuations.  We are nowhere close to 1999.  But that doesn't mean AMZN couldn't drop 35-40%+

Welcome back!  I bet lots to learn!  Having traded $CSCO, it can be frustrating to trade, but yes if market strong and breaks 47.10, worth a shot.  See how it broke to the downside too?  That is a riskier strategy but possible.  Best to wait on this one, imho.

$WMT, $CSCO, and $BABA all played ball this morning. $GOOGL bounced right off of yesterday's low by a few pennies. Either it is aiming for a triple inside day or just wants to wait on NVDA.

Mostly OTM short swings on $BAC and $CSCO

Lower premiums & OTM moves quick. Even just $1 OTM can pay 3-4x on a $.35-50 move in a day or two. Tues alone my blown calls paid 8x after flipping.

Both had beautiful low TF patterns I watched develop & gave backtests right to my TLs.
