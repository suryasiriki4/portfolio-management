Agreed. No pipe no production. What is more, no gas pipe could result in no oil production if Texas RRC enforces ND-like anti-flaring rules. I am surprised the likes of $XOM and $CVX aren‚Äôt litigating against flaring. And $BP is the biggest offender on flaring.

30 days before and after, for substantially identical securities. 

Basically, if you sell $CVX in late December, don't buy it back for a few weeks and you probably shouldn't buy $BP or $XOM during that time, either. You could buy an energy company though

$XOM is in major cost cutting moves right now, flights/hotels/cars, continued shift of older employee to contract, major cost cutting of XTO unit with all accounting getting moved to Argentina (huge labor discount). IMO shows where industry is going. Agree $CVX fee ops better

To add to this excellent overview, traders should note the price trend on a few stocks like $CVX or $CVE, both now trading near the bottom of what seems to be a well-defined range.
Could they continue to slide? Of course, but I'd argue that risk/reward now leans to the upside.",,,,,[],https://twitter.com/Timothy_Lewis/status/1220893592123736066

Just so I‚Äôm clear here:

- $XOM has their hand in every basin on the planet

- They choose the Permian basin as one of their top 5 focuses, 40 rigs running

- 2021: FCF neutrality

- 2023: $5bn in FCF

- $CVX has same story

- EFT says this is wrong cuz ‚Äúshale‚Äù

That about right?

Both heavily weighted in $XOM $CVX but $XLE only has about 26 other names while $VDE has around 135. So $VDE holding a lot of stuff that probably doesn't yield anything, brings down its average yield.

$hp stock price implies 300-400 rigs in U.S.  Prolly too high

I figured you would appreciate this anecdote: 

$CVX's Permian revisions of 50% less annual capex and 20% less production when exiting 2020 translates into just 22,620 less bbls of oil...

Unfortunately, not too material, but it's something!

$CVX undercut the 2008 & 2006 lows @ 52 was a 9.99% yield seems pretty extreme. Close Friday was above 2006 &2008 low.

Similar to $CVX both CEO's have been adamant about maintaining their dividends by cutting capital spending quite a bit. It cannot be indefinite but hopefully they can last until oil supply shrinks, which hopefully, happens soon if OPEC meetings go well.

What is next in the #oil market? Here are my expectations:

- OPEC+ will finalize & approve the cut tonight with or without #Mexico.  This will have a limited impact on the market in the short run

- Aramco will announce an OSP that reflects the production cut. Very bullish.

I guess the current thesis is that $XOM and $CVX will be the eventual duopoly that owns oil/gas markets.

However true, that is fucking nuts to be buying them now. They are going to fall hard.

Agreed -

I own $CVX which I think is a stronger company than $XOM, and $VZ - again feel it's better positioned than $T.

But I had my eye on all four.  Just went with the plays I felt more likely to profit.

I am not targeting them and agree with you. But How do they survive zero dollar oil?

Only with government intervention. No way they should be trading this high. Especially $cvx. Insane.

Oil prices does impact $XLE but $CVX and $XOM are not high Beta stocks (relative to Oil Prices). Unlike some of the smaller Oil companies such as $CRC $BRY $PXD $DVN. Good luck though with XLE next week.

Worked with many smart folks from chevron on billion dollar projects. 

I think their management is just waiting for returns to increase in renewables before they take it head on. Plus their cash flow to come from the Permian, and Gorgon just starting.

They will roll it up. More value in keeping it today than selling at a fire sale price. I think there will be PE interest at these prices from infra funds with capital to put to work and a sub $1 billion price being more than manageable, but no reason for $CVX to get desperate.

Ok, let's take one of them - Chevron $CVX, market cap 168B, U.S. population 0.33 billion, so each would get 509$ worth of stock (that you cannot sell, because you must own it). Annual income would be 11 dollars. Would that make everyone rich?

Good info, value/income oriented investors should take a look at $PFE which has an attractive valuation. $CVX also is a good buy for income investors looking for yield due to its solid financial footing. I would stay away from $WBA &  oil and gas industry name $XOM, high risks.

It's too early to call if the project peaked. $CVX's performance is still good. This largely reflects a spending revision similar to many of their Permian competitors.

$CVX is still paying the dividend, which yields almsot 6%. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-announces-quarterly-dividend-203000242.html‚Ä¶

I hate Chevron too, but unlike $XOM Exxon they're basically liquidating. Not replacing reserves. Going out of business.

I do understand and the payout ratio is extremely high. But do we have anything in this world to replace oil? No. So obviously the world needs the oil in many years to come. 

The oil price is gonna go up again and $XOM, $CVX and the others will continue to make money.

Second: No, not really, other than
- $CVX's 20% of AOSP
- Long shot on $RDS's 10% of AOSP and perhaps Scotford refinery +petchem ops, though that would be a big stretch in this climate.

$PXD sold 10 year bonds earlier this week at a 1.90% yield.

I'd rather own something like $CVX instead of that piece of paper. 

If $CVX cut its dividend by 50% it'd still be yielding almost 3%. Of course, if $CVX cuts its DPS by 50%, I suspect there'd be a large principal loss!

How can I trust a market riddled with more players than ever?
1. Pick a price and stick to it when buying.
2. Sell when the price achieves the price target upside you have picked on the upside.
The volatility has been crazy.
I use $CVX as a example.

45% of this ETF is $XOM $CVX. It's probably the only ETF more lopsided than $QQQ $XLK are with the FAANGs.

If you MUST play this sector just buy the two majors & collect the 9% divvies. September seasonality is bad on this ETF but firms up a little Oct-Dec so maybe wait til EOM.

5% - 30%. At the moment I'm 0% on #oil. If $SU goes below $16 I will get assigned and issue more on every $3 down all the way down to $1 if necessary.

$SU puts selling all the way until the day we go to the gas station and Petro Canada pays us to fill the tank.

You have to figure that those with the best balance sheets survive and takeover good assets cheap either from M&A or mergers.  Is $CVX the safest play on an oil rebound followed by $XOM?  Or pipeline companies like $KMI that just collect a toll as oil is moved?  Any opinions?

My plan is to slowly build positions in $TOT $CVX $RDS between now and the end of the year. Probably will ramp up if Dems sweep and they drop further. Also buying $BAC as part of my hold for a few years and see what the hell happens portfolio.

Easy answer. Buy the oil majors you believe will sustain the crisis and any crisis after this. 

Be aware of $XOM and it‚Äôs dividend. However the company is taking it seriously to keep the dividend growth, but there are better options when it comes to security, like $CVX.

3) $RIG $CVX. If Transocean had 7 billion in unsecured debt, for example, Chevron could snatch it all up for under 2 billion dollars on open mkt. They could borrow money at 3% and 2 billion wouldn‚Äôt even tickle their 140 Billion dollar market cap. Who knows. All just my fantasy.

Exxon Mobil isn't the only Big Oil company that's shrinking:

BP plans to cut 10,000 jobs, equivalent to 14% of its workforce
Shell will shed 9,000 workers, or 11%
Chevron will reduce its payroll by 6,000, a 13% reduction

I could see them keeping East Med.. W. Africa teams in place, albeit reduced numbers.

I suppose you could. Looks like March 2021 $CVX 10% OTM puts cost ~4.8%. If each security had similar hedging cost, could limit losses to 15%, which on 2x leverage means 30% of your equity. Divi yield pays for the protection. 

I‚Äôd probably not hedge though.

Does anyone really think $CVX will buy $RIG at this ridiculously low share price?  They will have to pay at least 5. If $RIG goes it alone, and WTI surges past 55, post vaccine/ post Covid/ post Biden ending US oil dominant World, $RIG stock goes to 15 a share very fast.

You might want to look at $XOP instead of $XLE which I think has a weighting of 43% is $XOM & $CVX.      The $XLE might be ""safer"" though, which is why most non-energy investors like it over the $XOP.    Just a thought.

Not opining on whether they're good investments, but you can avoid wash-sale issues by buying similar stocks - maybe $VLO or $PSX for $MPC and maybe $CVX or $XOM for $COP. Not perfect substitutes, but you only have to hold them 30 days, then can trade back. Or consider ETF $XLE.
