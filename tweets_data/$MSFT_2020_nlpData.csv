Bump this. I like the technical setup here. The other three charts are nice. $AAPL and $MSFT both lovely trending up. $GOOGL too just a little more choppy. $AMZN above the recent highs around 1825. Last candle kept the low above the 200 SMA only 4* from Morningstar must be winner

3 from Microsoft

0 from Amazon

Amazon strip mines great open source projects to drive AWS revenue well, but has released 0 meaningful open source projects while running the largest cloud since 2006.

The natural buyer for $ROKU is $WMT or $MSFT. 

Zero chance of AMZN. Would be immediately shut down by regulators. 

$AAPL buys nothing big (ever, thus far).

$FB Could work, but regulators would squash it.

Microsoft, the quintessential stock for this market moment, meets all prevailing investor preferences: software, durable growth, dividend-and-buyback cash, low China risk and, yes, ESG. Is unanimous acclaim a buy signal or caution flag? Weekend column.

Agreed. I put it this way: what's the probability I'm going to be wrong on $msft and say $xom fcf? 100% chance.

What is the magnitude of that error? With $msft maybe 20% max. With $xom, 50 to 100%.

Kne of those is one I don't want to be long.

For me $MSFT is a clear winner for the next 5 years. 

Much slower growth than the arguably more exciting hyper-growth SaaS co's - but I think it will be a steady performer.

if $MSFT holds above 197, the next short-term targets are 220 and then 229

Big if.  I wouldn't say it's $MSFT.  More finite revenue streams with higher susex.  But similar multiple.  Cash cow.  Low PE.  Long record of growth.  Just wondered it the pharma analysts see key risk of reversal of fortune.  Insider selling lately.

Fun looking back on old internal value investment memos.

The mainstream financial media is in love w/ $MSFT today at a $1.4T mkt cap, or 30x EBIT of ~$50B, however I had courage to buy when everyone hated it at <8x EBIT of ~$28B in 2012.

They even had the old logo back then!

Here‚Äôs the beauty about ultrafast growers: these companies grow so fast that Wall Street can‚Äôt value them very accurately. This can leave a stock inefficiently priced, providing a big opportunity for superperformance. There's no appropriate PE for a stock growing at a huge rate.

$MSFT to ATH Count

$MSFT is currently in CHOP city, seeing an extended WXY correction on a lower degree, trading in a range

Should we hold above my invalidation level at 208.16, I think we could see ATH with a bullish range break

Looks good if we can break 220

I worked at $MSFT and $AMZN so they are both about 10% - 12% each (5+ year holds), but for 

25% of my net worth and still sleep (new) I would put it in $NVDA it is going to be the growth monster of the decade

With rates low, the market a a whole probably deserves 18-19x. $AAPL probably deserves some premium to that, maybe up to 25x, not higher I don't think. 

By 2025, $AAPL will have generated ~$400bn in cash, so that + 25x $90-100bn is $2.25-$2.5 trillion = ~4-6% IRR's. 5/6
