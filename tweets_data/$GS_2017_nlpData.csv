This chart shows why Bitcoin Futures could become a systemic risk: #Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has risen to 100% vs 6.4% for S&P 500 and 4.2% for Global Bonds, making Bitcoin one of the most volatile financial instruments.

Bitcoin: my answer to the repeated questions.
No, there is NO way to properly short the bitcoin ""bubble"". Any strategy that doesn't entail options is nonergodic (subjected to blowup). Just as one couldn't rule out 5K, then 10K, one can't rule out 100K.
