Think about it. Would you? If you're $NKE you want to do 2 not-exactly-the-same things: move a TON of stuff and provide a unique experience.

$FL doesn't spend anything. Nike doesn't want FL controlling a $400 shoe experience. It's too late for stores. The brands became stores.

Every department store has the same problem. It's going to get super worse.

$NKE sells their best stuff on http://Nike.com and at a handful of stores. Totally controls the transaction. $FL and $M and $DKS fight for scraps.

The answer is networking in-stock. Service.

$AA is going higher, just need the next two days to confirm the upside move IMO. $M moves really slow, so it needs some more time to start rallying up. $NKE looks like it needs to consolidate to then try to breakout that $86.04 level. $SFM has some big resistance at $25.

Nice call and nice trade thesis.   Buying on the $NKE shoe debocle would have been nice as well.   Good work with your watch list. I was critical at start of week, but good analysis.  Only recommendation would be to look for stocks with RVOL >1, meaning higher than norm action.

Good question, Andrew. We're long $NKE and have been warning about a meltdown in CPG stocks. No one cares about CPG brands except as a short cut for knowing they are buying good quality at a good price. But $NKE is an identity brand. Here's our take:

Not sure that's right. Is $NKE a ""prestige"" brand like $TIF, $RACE, etc? It isn't that expensive & not a sign of wealth. But it is an ""identity"" brand. It says to you & others that you're an athlete. Rich or poor, it says you can ""just do it"". Identity is about more than wealth.

Conspicuous consumption, social media, & Nike still has megastars. Too many annual $ incs have inc'd the value of swapping down to generics and dec'd the cost of trading up to ""superior"" products.

$NKE protects down via Converse, sales, and ""regular"" products.

There is no corollary in shoes. Unbranded shoes are not better or healthier. So new shoe companies must compete head to head with $NKE and overcome a lot of brand equity. This is a much tougher proposition.

So, both $LYFT and $UBER will probably succeed IMO. They are already too big. Time will tell.

The same can be said (and has been said about nearly every IPO) - valuation is never the death blow.  Heck, $CROX ran up to the point of having a market cap that was 1/2 of $NKE. The 60% short interest rate makes BYND unshortable and it will be unshortable until the lockout ends.

Nike $NKE, currently higher for 4th day of 5, +1.0% at $83.25. Big resistance at the 50dma in the 84s, where it got stuck last time. 
Fine company, but looks vulnerable with the main market, with an open gap to the $77s. E' Jun'20th in AH... notably just after the next FOMC.

Tiger himself arguably made a dent on rounds played in April, which were higher yr/yr, working against a grim trend (2018 rounds played fell >4% and were down in 11/12 months).

But, yeah, golf is not a growth space. $NKE is playing for Athleisure share.

If you were making an initial investment in a baby's college fund, and wanted to be equal-weight in 5 stocks to start it with - you have to hold them for 18 years - which 5 would you choose?

Purely for conversation and curiosity.

To me $UA occupies the worst position. They‚Äôre not going to replace $NKE. Don‚Äôt have the brand (were on a nice trajectory briefly). And they don‚Äôt offer the value Skechers does. $UA is going to end up lowering their prices IMO. Making your original question all the more valid.

I‚Äôd rather own $NKE, of course. Hard to justify the premium at the moment IMO. Sort of like their shoes, $SKX offers similar financial performance at half the multiple. Not long ago PE was 12. Here in Peru (India? China?) Skechers are a fashion statement.

I see both sides. Returning is easy but it does take time. I'd rather try shoes on in a store first as opposed to ordering through $NKE even though I do both at times. Even in big cities like nyc there are only a couple Nike stores. But all Americans live near an $FL store

So, $BZUN brings in big brands with a flat fee and then cross-sells them, while also taking a % of all they sell. As for $NKE and others: it's not that much about content, but about strategy: omnichannel marketing, a bit like $TTD, by using big data. That's quite specialized.

I think Steve Weiss' point was he preferred to invest in  $NKE rather than $FL, b/c their generous return policy was likely taking business away from $FL.
As for trying out shoes in a store to get the size right, most people already know their shoe size.

Love the $UAA call.  I understand that it‚Äôs not $NKE but the disparity in market caps between the two is insane.  $NKE almost $140B.  $UA = $8.5B.  That doesn‚Äôt make sense when you just count logos on the street.  The idea that someone could buy $UA for $11-$12B is nuts.

$NKE didn‚Äôt like the CEO change news. It creates concerns about stability. Price needs to clear & sustain back over 90 or can fully fill the gap to $87.18, which has a 100MA confluence. It‚Äôs getting late to short, but $NKE has to prove itself. I‚Äôll discus in my Mid-Week Video.

You might need a refresher course in how fundamental economics works. Yes, consumers generate revenue, but only after a company creates a product they crave (see $AAPL, $AMZN, $NKE, $SBUX, $LULU).

Nearly 60% of what $AMZN sells is just fulfillment. It‚Äôs not Amazon product at all. If we‚Äôre honest it‚Äôs little better than a flea market. 

$NKE does an awful lot of marketing to have their brand associated with the crap Amazon is shipping.

It‚Äôs true.  But I see waaaaaaaaay more $UA out there than $LULU and for it to be 4x the market cap doesn‚Äôt seem right.

$NKE = $151B
$ADDYY = $60B
$LULU = $30B
$UA = $8B
$SKX = $6B

$UA just seems way out of whack on this list for how much you see of each out there.

Yup. There‚Äôs a whole brand-control tailwind $NKE has which others don‚Äôt. Pulling from $AMZN is just the beginning. 

It‚Äôs related to how/ why I ended up with 2 pair of Yeezys from the adidas app. Stores have to earn the right to have NKE and adidas. That‚Äôs a big value shift.
