Finally got my hands on a @Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered Windows 10 laptop. HOLY SH** is it good. I've used it for easily 6-8 hours now travelling from US>AU, doing work now for an hour and it hasn't budged from 64% in that hour. 36% battery so far = 8 hours+ for me. Game changing.

Don't underestimate the negative impact of sky high valuations.

I would say maybe the market is betting on some other company buying it like $MSFT, $AAPL or $AMZN, but that would be a huge chunk of change for any company and likely not a good idea considering the regulatory scrutiny most of them are under.

2/ If MapR falls there will be only one on-premises Hadoop at that point for MANY companies that have data there. If you are $IBM, $GOOG, $AMZN, $MSFT the $1B net price tag is cheap ($CLDR is $1.5B and has $500MM in cash).

Could be right. I just think there are strong up and coming competitors in each of those markets that are focused on just one or two things rather than such a wide variety of things.

My extreme view is that the $FB, $AMZN, $MSFT, $GOOGL of the world are potentially the next $GEs

I would guess $CSCO before $MSFT. CSCO will buy anything that grows and could disrupt their business (except ANET ironically enough). CSCO's moat is literally their mountain of cash.

Seems like $MSFT trying to strengthen themselves as a developers resource based on Github, Azure, etc Question is if all that will bring in enough profits to outpace the potentl decrease in legacy (which already seems to be much slower decrease in last 5 years than many thought)

To do an apples to apples comparison you have to overlay the returns over the same stage in each network's trajectory. This comparison is like comparing Microsoft's returns to Google's from 2004 to 2014. Totally worthless. You need to take $MSFT's from IPO to make any sense.

$SPY daily 200MA test. the last 2 times they defended it pretty well off the lows. What they do this time dictate my bias for the next few days. if strong close (long wick off daily lows) then good time to start looking for Calls on relative strength names. vice versa for puts.

$MSFT - perhaps the most successful business the world has ever seen - trades around 8x sales.  What sales multiples should good software companies trade at much faster growth rates than MSFT trade at?  Certainly higher than 8x.  Group simple average is currently 11.8x.

What I presented was a mathematical framework to think of ‚Äújustifiable‚Äù multiples. I am sure there was a time when $MSFT was at 10-20 or even 30x revenue. That turned out just fine obviously. The key is whether these advantages are sustainable and scalable.

While I am not invested in $MSFT, I think going in the different direction than the rest is not necessarily a bad thing. The margin on hardware is mostly low (except for the iPhone) and it's Microsoft's core competency to provide the software for everything, not the hardware.

$100k of $MSFT stock = $738 a year in dividends, free!

Plus he'd technically still have the $100k [it's just in stocks], and any reinvestment of the dividend money (e.g. buying more stocks with it) doesn't get taxed as stocks aren't money.

The $100k was a good move.

While investors are bearish and have trimmed speculative longs (see the IPO wasteland), they are all hiding in big cap monopolies like $AAPL, $BA and $MSFT, and as such, the indices are barely budging. 

These monopolies, for the most part, got underlying bids from buybacks.

Keep in mind a lot of the big names are traded very heavily in the US markets and the US markets are still sitting at all time highs. If you are going to sell $MSFT to lock in profits, then selling $CGC to offset the gain is smart tax planing.

No, they're not.
$FB, $MSFT, $AAPL, $AMZN, $GOOGL are wildly profitable. The dotcoms were nearly universally unprofitable and most were committing blatant accounting fraud. People bragged about buying stock in companies without being able to explain their business.
