I really like it :) and will look deeper into some of the companies. I try to think the same way with e.g
$CRSP (3.4b) vs $SGMO (950M) 
$INTC (258b) vs $AMD (44b)
$FTSV (1.6b) vs $TRIL (160M)
I am in the 'right' ones as I consider them to have superior tech for a lower price.

$intc still closed into gap yesterday, up PM with broad market but I'm looking to see how we do under Friday's low.  I have 30 of the 2/14 66p. I'm probably going to try and scalp 100 to 200 of the weekly 64/65s at some point today. Think there is tremendous opportunity there.

In my opinion:

$NVDA > $AVGO > $INTC > $TSM

Custom ASICs will benefit both AVGO (design) & TSM (manufacturing). 

But NVDA's power-efficiency advantage means it still has a very long runway ahead. IMHO.

Replying to @PatrickMoorhead and @AMD
Don't be silly, you know Q1 2019 was an absolute disaster of a quarter /w 23% revenue decline. Revenue was down q/q & pretty much flat with Q1 2018, so no growth. Stock trades at a TTM PE of 188 /w declining forward revenue.

That's a 90% haircut on due on multiple contraction.

$NVDA could open at $330 or $350 after all it’s now earning week. The run so far has been great — $200B market cap — larger than all in their sector except $INTC ($250B). Even paid a small dividend which surprised me back in March. My *guess* we swing a bit but hit $367 by ER.

Replying to @daesr1 and @RaviRomo
I agree. Mobileye ($INTC) is pushing its own platform, but $NVDA should score the bulk of the non-$TSLA contracts. This could be an enormous biz for Nvidia within the next 5-10 years, given that the Mercedes tie-up alone should generate $5B+ in annual sales...

Pre-Mkt Tesla is up another $100 to $1650, or ~7%.  This will push its mkt cap to over $300 billion, passing JPM, MasterCard and P&G to move into the top 10 by value.

I BELIEVE this is the first time a US company has reached the top 10 in value and was NOT in the S&P 500.

After a disastrous 10nm rollout, Intel is now saying 7nm is one year behind schedule. It has so little confidence in its own fab that it's looking to make its upcoming GPU at TSMC.

Imagine Tesla asking GM to manufacture its latest car. That's the state of Intel today.

$INTC screw up helped boost future prospects of $TSM and $AMD, while they both had great earnings reports for the past quarter. Add some short interest, and it was a perfect storm for both stocks to gap and go for days.

I have been closely monitoring $INTC for quite a bit time now.

I am waiting for a good entry opportunity at the 44$-45$ range.

If the stock falls to that range I believe that we could have a snap back up to 51$-53$.

Also on $WBA undervalued camp. $CVS never sold after the merger and them stopping dividend hikes. but want to see that restarted first. $INTC have fallen behind in Moore's law race (delay of 7nm), so it's more of a Schrödinger's cat valuation. Could be undervalued and overvalued.

When Intel announced the 7nm news, AMD stock gained as much as Intel lost. Investors view Intel’s loss as AMD’s gain. The market is mistaking. Intel is a data-centric conglomerate.

$AMD is starting to look interesting again. Nice move on it in the 2nd half of the day. A run-up back to the top of the ascending triangle (~$59) is likely imo. 
STOCHs is narrowing so keep an eye on that but the upper BB is opening up (not shown).

If you like income but no capital appreciation, go wtmith $T, $INTC is under value right now, but I am better investing my money to $TSM or $AVGO.  Both have dividend growth.  I like $V too.  You could double your money in 5 years.

It is so easy for one’s head to get cluttered.  I remind myself daily the “why” of investing,  the opportunity cost of holding “wrong”, or holding a “good company” while they have a setback (i.e. $INTC).  Step aside, revisit when catalysts in place.

$XOM I have not jumped in due to worries about the dividend. Do you have any concerns on that considering they essentially used debt to pay it last quarter?

Don't sell.  Think long term. Don't trade unless you know what your doing or you will lose your shirt.

$AMD is decent buy, but $INTC is on sale and undervalued atm. Make sure you do your own homework and don't rely on ""hot tips"" like these.

This is my daily struggle =) Does $INTC turn-around? What about $CSCO? $CSGS, $YELP, $NTAP the list goes on.

Using a more quality/value screen has helped me behaviorally as well (Additional margin of safety).

But the ultimate win is still the same. Multiple expansion.

Risk management question. Do you use a stop on the pairs? Static or moving or does it have a time component? What about the edge cases like  $TSLA / $INTC, where you saw a 7 deviation move. If you aren't stopped, are you adding to the position?

I must be incredibly bored, but I just sold some $NKLA weekly puts (tiny position) violating a cardinal rule of never doing so on a position that I would mind owning.

The rest of the day has been more rational with $BAC, $INTC and $UAA

$INTC was already losing to $AMD and now $NVDA is about to smoke both of them but $INTC is the biggest loser in this trio. They’re starting to feel like irrelevant like

When I worked at $INTC, we always knew you got promoted into the job you had been unofficially doing for the two years prior.
Think/act/contribute like a VP and soon enough you would be made one.
It's a good rubric for life generally.

The $AMD core counts on their CPU had exceeded that of $INTC a short while ago.  $AMD has beaten $INTC in single core clock speed just now with the release of Ryzen Zen 3 series.  Now $AMD is cheaper and faster than $INTC.  Intel is the underdog now.

$INTC will be a winner again. $AMD has the limelight but history proves they are considered the 2nd player in data center and pcs. They have altera acquisition to compete with xilnix. They lost some market shares this year therefore the stock is down!

This is exactly what the experts talked about.

I need to get longer semis. The next 10 years is going to be an insane run for the leaders.

$INTC has a ton of issues. They need to execute on, I think it's the 10nm, that they're developing. Or big trouble.

If you had a rough day/week, you're surely not alone! 
A positive mindset is vital in this business. Next week is a new week and a new month and we rebuild back up. 

Will be off twitter for a couple more days, we're in the midst of moving from Oregon to Arizona for a few months!

Think like investing in companies:

The US & Europe have diluted their shareholder to pay a bonus to all employees, which went on vacation, unclear when they’ll return.

China & ASEAN haven’t diluted. Reinvested returns into R&D + digital currency.

I know where I‘ll put my bet.

I disagree 99%. Data processing leaders (by type) historically have maintained their top position.

Look at how $INTC has made many many egregious errors, yet is still the leader (for now).

Don't underestimate the advantages of leadership in the space.

The only reason to own $INTC over $AMD or $NVDA is valuation but it’s cheap because it has no growth and it’s getting crushed by those other two. $INTC is lucky there are trillions of dollars in value funds that need to have semi exposure can’t justify paying 50x earnings

Would add that Otellini's decision to ""pass"" on being the CPU supplier for the iPhone eventually led to TSM having both scale and learning curve advantages with profound consequences.

The argument is that they weakening in 3 of 4 business areas Mobile phones, laptops n PC.  The later two are decreasing overall. Data centers seem to be the only area where they KL survive. Analyst think that $INTC does not have growth potential. Anyways future will tell us.

Thanks for sharing that info. I knew about Intel, not about AMD.

I find this a very interesting case study. 

I consider $INTC in the category of $IBM at the moment. 

I don't want to touch it until they convince me otherwise. (hint: radical innovation)

Not sure about $INTC, however the others are fine imo. $INTC are losing more and more market share to others in it’s sector, now even $AAPL changed their chips from Intel to their own. 

That doesen’t sound to me that they believe in $INTC, but rather that they can do better.

Amazon either working or already had its ARM datacenter chip.  $INTC one/two generations behind on size.  

Is it non-fixable?  Right management can probably turn it around.

1/ Nothing comprehensive, but the basic gist is simple:
$INTC makes most of money from server processors. Core customers like $AMZN, $GOOG, $MSFT all developing their own chips, as $AMD and $NVDA take share there as well.

Meanwhile, $INTC been distracted with large acquisitions.

I agree with you a lot of people disregard $INTC billions in free cash flow like they have that money sitting around. But these times right now everyone is chasing growth compared to value. Maybe this time around value will finally make a comeback.

Everyone told me that 2 years ago, and look at their share price in that time. 0% profit in 2 years vs $NVDA and $AMD's ~200% each.

And I suspect it'll be another 3 years before $INTC is in a healthy position again. By then, their competition will be much more established.

$INTC is setting up nicely for a swing trade.

If the price pushes into the 53 area I would start in short. 

If it pushes higher I would add in at the 54 area. 

Stops would be set above MA on the daily chart.

1st target would the 51 and then the second target would be 48.50.

What was your list in 2000? A lot of these are good companies. a couple of them are great. technology changes. ask $INTC. ask $IBM. #neversell is a great aspiration. but it's not very realistic, especially in technology.

If NASDAQ/NYSE are concerned, Since I noticed you have recommended for $FB.

$TSLA, $INTC, $NVDA, $NVDA, $MSFT, $V (Visa), $VZ (5G and Other Advancements) & $AMZN.

I have some more but I'm skipping them right now.

I'm bearish when it comes to $AAPL.

$INTC - the pain of the last two earnings calls have taught me a lot about size & spend on R&D vs innovation and the importance of execution. Sometimes things really are cheaper for a reason.

The issue with $INTC is manufacturing in US. https://intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000015142/programs.html….  $INTC can't compete with semis from Asia.

Why when you can buy other stocks that are moving to make more $$$, and then buy $FUTU when it break the bullflag, or ath break out? 
That's like holding $INTC because one day it will come back, could be years.
