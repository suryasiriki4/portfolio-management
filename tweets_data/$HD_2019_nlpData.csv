Marvin's track record at $JCP does not exactly instill confidence. $LOW has under-invested for years and now is allegedly going to take-share, expand margins/ROIC whilst investing less (significantly so relative to $HD capex). I do not see this ending well...

Arguably true but the cylical nature of their end-market shouldn‚Äôt be ignored. I still believe $HD offers a far better TSR over the next couple of years. $LOW has made strategic mistakes and continues to do so by constricting investment that the business needs

Finally got my hands on a @Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered Windows 10 laptop. HOLY SH** is it good. I've used it for easily 6-8 hours now travelling from US>AU, doing work now for an hour and it hasn't budged from 64% in that hour. 36% battery so far = 8 hours+ for me. Game changing.

$LOW selling for 14.5 x FCF while $HD is selling for 20 x FCF. $HD is a well run business, I get it, but I am wondering if such a gap in valuation is rational? Mr. Market might be offering me a very fair price for $LOW at the moment.

I was surprised how hard it was to find any info on this research at all.

Sure. But also price increases, margin expansion. I've been inflation agnostic for years, but am starting to see it on the shelves at Safeway. At $HD too, though they have other headwinds.

Clorox lost some distribution in BBQing at $HD or $LOW. Bigger issue is they tried to take pricing in key categories like trash bags & competitors just under cut & are eating the lower margins. 

Bigger take away is consumers are very price sensitive.

1) As 
@1MainCapital
 pointed out, pro penetration is much higher at $HD - so you get better sales / sq. ft. productivity.

2) Margins are higher at $HD than $LOW. Part of this is due to higher pro penetration, but part of it is also due to worse labor efficiency vs. $HD.
