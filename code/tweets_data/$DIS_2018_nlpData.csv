Dow Gains, Part III: IBM (162.49) is poised to break above its resistance at 162.51, giving me a near-term upside target to the low 180s; JNJ (141.71) is about to break resistance at 144.35 - in so doing, it would afford me a target to at least the 150 level.

If you put $DIS-Fox content against $NFLX, there's no contest. So you can pay 150x to own $NFLX here or 15x to own $DIS which is basically launching a 'Netflix' later this year. Plus ESPN+, huge movie pipeline - things I've discussed many times over..

#BlackPanther opened to staggering results with roughly $75M on its opening day. One third was from THU pre-shows. That's on the same level as #CaptainAmericaCivilWar but w/o the jumbo pack of famous super heroes. 3day might reach about $185M, 4day could do $210M+. Gigantic!

You bet... I take advantage and buyvwhen I can. Drops always recover nicely.... you can also flip to recover.... IMO a merger or buyout may be in play... You never lose if you don't sell..... Too much volume.... One good move can put $NVCN over .20 easy.

So you accept now that the value of #F1 $FWONK FELL 22.2% in the past 6 months whereas Disney $DIS ROSE 1.6% as I initially said. Thank you.

Iger's answer: Continued growth is possible because parks (especially Shanghai) will continue to expand, IPs will drive growth as parks use them more and they grow more popular, and as parks expand and improve services that provides leverage to increase prices. $DIS

Disney is in such a good position they don‚Äôt need fox although it‚Äôs puts them in a more dominant position. Disney just needs to focus on OTT app and ESPN app. Everything else is working. Disney app can easily get to 30 mil subs without trying. $dis $foxa $cmcsa

I'd add there's an underlying assumption here that Trump base/Roseanne viewers are ""mass selling"" shares of $DIS. Fact: 84% of stocks are held by top 10% wealthiest Americans, & the rest who have something invested via a ret. plan are usually in mutual funds--not direct holdings.

$DIS have always been one of my favourites because the long term outlook is great. They‚Äôll own 40% of all entertainment once deal goes through. Once they control more IP‚Äôs their Box Office numbers and Toy sales will skyrocket. And their Netflix competitor will be game changing.

Given the flop of SOLO I expect earnings could be a miss.  But I‚Äôm in this purely for the TA baby!

Longer term I see the Fox acquisition as very bullish.  They will own a majority stake of Hulu. My bet is the $DIS streaming service is a bluff and they will integrate into Hulu.

ESPN needs a life line as traditional sports are decreasing in viewership. I think the $DIS/$ATVI partnership is going to be very profitable long term. Especially if $DIS's streaming service picks it up.

2/n the extremely high quality kids movies that $DIS creates lends themselves to outright purchases, versus subscription model where you steam over the internet.

The more I use Netflix, the more convinced I am that there will indeed be a few top video streaming subscription services. It's still early.

Disney will end up being a leader (their IP is simply too good)
Apple Video will have a fighting chance
AT&T / HBO (assuming talent stays)

I like this write-up. $NFLX has been successful, but they've done it with little streaming competition. $DIS and $AAPL set to change that, $T going bigger with HBO, I think $FB gets into the mix too.

Also agree that for the $ they're spending, they don't have a ton of hits. twitter.com/neilcybart/sta‚Ä¶

Yeah I don‚Äôt see how $wmt becomes a huge player here. $amzn has a pretty good record of not making money so they might have the stamina for it. But Hulu, $DIS, hbo, espn, - basically what‚Äôs on tv, do you think they will disappear? Probably just go onto competing platforms.

I think the opportunity is really in the top 5% at current pricing and even then it is more like $dis opportunity in markets where $nflx already exists... but more competitive already. If Sacred Games et al had earned Indian 0.5% of Ondian market it would have been all q3 subs.
