I turned $1000 into $7500 buying the $175 Jan 19 $HD call when Home Depot was trading at $163.  I sold out early when the stock hit $181.  However, I'll take that return any day.  I've also made a lot buying the $105 $DIS strike when Disney was trading at $96 a share.

$HD and $WMT report before the bell Tues. If both good, or at least $WMT is, then that 2nd close in a row above the 50-day on $SPX was worth betting on.

 A lot pf people on #FinTwit Friday were sure that we're done for now with a failure to hold 20-day. Maybe, maybe not!

In all fairness $HD did a whole lot of nothing until 2012 when cheap interest rates made housing go crazy. Cannot fairly compare a tech stock to $HD. Look at a 20 yr chart of $AMZN or $AAPL and compare it with $HD, $AMZN and $AAPL have much better returns than $HD

$HD. The call was great, not transformative. Huge comps. That’s not enough with how the stocks have run. 

Not much of a pick-me-up. Gotta wait. 

Whenever retail has a run ppl suddenly realize how bad the margins are. (“5%!?”). The big stocks need a rest.

@LaMonicaBuzz I nominate $LOW as stupid stock move. Up 10% and earnings guidance not that great, housing slowing and getting CEO from $JCP. I don’t short stocks but can’t understand why that one is up so much.

(a)  They like their house - that is why they bought it in the first place.
(b)  They have the money to invest in an asset they like.

I wasn't aware of the $BAC target of $100, but it makes sense. Target has net margins (something I drone on about) twice as good as $WMT... roughly 4% vs 2%... never mind that $WMT is almost 25% more expensive!

$HD chartwise: 10 EMA tag & bounce. 50% retrace on daily also. Target for this bull flag if it holds 220 to start with. Reversal candle on weekly. Weekly 10 EMA at 200.84.

OI: If it can get over 210, 215 might be next resistance. Support 205 then 200.

I am not too sure on very short term price action. But with back test since last Wed, I believe and am betting $HD is bound to $220 then $230 coming weeks.

Big support at $185 level. My guess; If chart continues to mimic Feb 2018 then end of October will be $184 then $hd will begin nxt leg up. The store's tight/low stock may be b/c they  r setting themselves up to be the Amazon of building material. See the video in this thread.

Fair biz playing fields are a bi-partisan concern.  Both liberals and conservatives see the value in making sure that $HD Home Depot does not crush our friend's small hardware store.  

Woops, too late already.  But that's not permanent.  Let's overturn this polluted legislation.

Think of all the tax revenue lost from book stores, hardware stores & small businesses hurt by an oligopoly like $AMZN or $HD Home Depot.  It's part and parcel to the dumbing-down of America.

By recycling operating cash flow into capex, America's infrastructure suffers directly.

$HD is in the Retail Darkpool of stocks I don’t personally own. So it’s getting less attention but HD shares are quietly down 15% this month. 

Also a tough month for Target, still being punished for saying the consumer was “the best” (someday it won’t be!) $TGT $WMT

There's an additional way to see $HD psychologically; Lets say Ive been short since low $200s, and now gained $30-$40 on the downside, most reasonable traders would be taking some profits, and not get overly greedy. Odds now, are to the upside

I didn’t pass, tried next week instead of today because I hate playing same day exp on Friday as you know but order didn’t get filled due to wide ask/bid.  :(
Looks like if I don’t follow, you rock. If I do, it sucks like $HD. LoL

The drop was not hard to predict. $AMD and other semis missed. Companies like $HD beat, still dropped. Gamers & cryptos were down. It was easy to see this miss coming so I wouldn't pat yourself on the back too much this time. A bigger concern, semis pos. signal a cooling economy

Agreed. Seems like home improvement retailers like $HD and $LOW can go down a lot. People forget that due to their exposure to construction these are cyclical businesses

Can't own retail here. $HD was the tell. It's possible $JWN didn't even miss. They seem to have a whole different scorecard. TBH the street is going to sell anything, regardless. None of them have cited weak shoppers. 

I'm already bracing for $TGT to beat by 100% and drop $12.

Did you see $HD? I’m not sure why a bad reaction to $WMT is a surprise. I’m openly not trading them for a reason (beyond being a sissy). $WMT released 3 sheets of data. No one discovered a secret code this morning; there are sellers lurking everywhere. They find a reason later.

When you need calm in this market, big diff between BTFD and buy the fear and sell the greed. We stay calm in this group; we make $, we are patient.  When you come in 3rd for competition that you learned from; you don't expect a gift.

Thanks!  That inside #60Anchor level break to the downside at 1015 was money!  $HD got slammed.  Large body red-shooter to close.  Eyeing weekly 200sma.  Right at median support, so look for a pivot then up channel to 167 or breakdown further to 155, then sub 150!

Shame.  Watching $HD wanting to explode. When we turn they be some missing out by some on stocks. 10/15% on individuals easy.

I still think the consumer is strong. I like Home Depot here. We own it. Now too cheap. $HD I love control4, we own. Too cheap $ctrl home builders too cheap. Now rates coming down... buying these short term bonds. #housing related stocks.

That;'s amazing...considering $HD didn't even go public until 1981. 

The Initial Public Offering of Home Depot Common Stock was on September 22, 1981.
