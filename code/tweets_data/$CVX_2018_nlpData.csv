Interesting that $XOM rumored to be looking at Endeavor - one of the biggest/most mature private’s (w/o a lot of PE $$s if memory serves) along with $CVX. I think Endeavor is what the PE-backed co’s will need to aspire to if they want to see good exit valuations.

Certainly it's good to have a target, but it will also be a pinata for the center and the right. Higher taxes, will hurt millions retirement savings in blue chip stocks like $XOM and $CVX, ensures equity thru redistribution, enables incompetence thru job guarantee, etc etc
