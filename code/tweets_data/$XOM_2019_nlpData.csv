You can be as far OTM as you want; pick a strike price that makes sense for the expiration date. Determine how long you would like your swing trade to last. If you are starting out I would recommend more conservative ATM or slightly OTM options and see how that works out for you.

Yeah John I saw that a while back BUT I read it as that guys did ""spread its costs over such a big operation that the basin will become competitive""

AVERAGE cost not Permian cost. and MORE pumping to lower average cost will destroy pricing

$scty bailout was a fraudulent related party transaction.   The solar roof is not real.  The Theranos analogy has some validity.  $xom may be guilty of bad capital allocation at times (e.g. $xto) but afaik they haven't acq'd related co's on the basis of synergies w/fake products

He'll probably be worth enough money from sponsorship deals to be a majority equity holder in the onshore portion. Though $XOM will fight him on branding.

$XOM can be a nightmare intraday moving 25 cents in minutes. But I do agree, one timeframe up it really does show a good trend. It used to be one of my favorites and still is on a swing timeframe.

That would be the weirdest strategy to sell yourself I have ever seen...  From what I've seen, $CVX already has very good wells in the Permian, on both sides of the basin. $XOM's are ok but not nearly as good, specially in Midland. Would concur with Robert here.

I think I misread your question, thought you were asking about $XOP. You asked about $XOM, its higher quality than the smaller E&P's, so if earnings are good the safe money might move to Exxon and maybe push it up a few dollars, esp if it's better than $CVX, sorry for misreading!

I love $XOM and owned it for a little while a couple years back. Problem is its relative valuation. I had an interesting convo with an energy hedge fund guy who said the most relevant valuation metric is CFO / EV, where $XOM is still like 2x the price of other majors.

The challenge is you have to normalise everything. In our case for $XOM I know that changes oil prices explain more than the 80% variance in the operating margin so I'll try to get a normalised operating margin. How do you normalise CFO? Average/Median? Intuitive?

You're looking at it from a different perspective. We can both be right. If I put 75% of my portfolio in a S&P index fund and 25% in $MO, $XOM and $MCD I would've outperformed the market over time. I view indexing as a hedge against risk, you see it as logical inconsistency.

Because I do my DD & they're sitting on oil & gas reserves (much of it shale from the Permian Basin) & they own 100% of the rights to ALL OF IT & it's estimated to be worth between $2 to $5 BILLION! If $XOM buys them for $375/share that's $2.21375 BILLION. A bit on the low side.

The only thing that makes it useful is that it's equal weighted. The top 10 holdings are weighted roughly the same as say holdings 30 through 40. Never understood the refiners in there though. It's either $XOP or the $XLE (which is about 42% $XOM and $CVX). Really not much choice

This presidential tweet reads like the president is no longer delaying implementation of part of the new tariffs until dec. He had previously decided to delay tariffs on more than half of these tariffs until dec 15 due to the negative effects on Xmas. This suggests no delay. twitter.com/realDonaldTrum‚Ä¶

Great question! Long version: https://buff.ly/2AfnI44

SRI came before ESG but now most SRI funds use ESG data.

Appreciate the response. Surprised at the $300 million figure given that Matson's two latest ConRos cost $255 million each, and those are more complicated vessels, no? CRS places the JA tanker premium at 4x that of a foreign build, but you're indicating 5x. Yikes.

$XOM obviously blew it on XTO (as you so memorably mentioned!) and I'm not smart enough to judge what they're doing in the Permian, but it seems like investing heavily into chemicals and downstream is the right move. They've been terrific there historically.
