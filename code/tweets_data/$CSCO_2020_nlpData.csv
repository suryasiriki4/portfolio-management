my bad, I was using the monthly, on $CSCO to get that 93.54 March 2000 reading high.  The weekly indeed was about the same as July 1998.  $AAPL daily, weekly, monthly RSI here are 82, 88, 75 in that order.  August 2018 being the prior monthly peak for $AAPL so far at 78.

$AAPL is $CSCO in 1999. UBER, LYFT and WE are Altavista, Yaho, http://Pets.com etc. 

Fair that its not quite at the same level. But question whether we can ever get to that level of BS as a major top or we need a  generation who have forgotten all the lessons.

Winner!

It's $CSCO...an incredibly successful company who is the clear market leader in Ethernet networking & infrastructure. $50B in revenue, 19 P/E. And still 33% below its peak stock price and 60% below peak market cap. This is how I see $TSLA playing out best case long term

Here's how each stock performed between 2000 & 2020:

$EBAY: +448%
$MSFT: +170%
$CSCO: -10.5%

eBay is the least relevant company of the three today. But it was -- by far -- the best performing stock (despite trading for the highest valuation of the three) over the next 20 years.

Growth rates and margins were impressive. $MSFT and $CSCO were simply too massive already to leave much upside over the long haul.

I agree, Kyle. I like what $CSCO is doing in IoT and cyber security. They also seem to have a knack for buying competition before it becomes a major threat.

$ORCL's margins are high, but their customers hate the abusive pricing power. I see its moat eroding over the decade.

If you bought equal portions of $ADBE, $CSCO, $JNPR on 10/31/2000 your average annualized return on 3/2/2020 would be 6.6% (vs 6.1% S&P total). So not only am I intentionally choosing a date at the the dot com peak, but also making 2 bad picks vs one good. Still not bad right?

I would offer the example of $CSCO in 2000. It hit a high around 85 in March of 2000, then when it hit 55 pundits and other know-nothings recommended it for ""long-term"" investors. It eventually went to 8, and today trades at 39.50, 20 years later.

There is another silent competitor called Webex from $CSCO. Many companies are shifting to webex as they see security issues with zoom and webex has slack like interface for chatting as well.  Not sure how much impact it is having on $CSCO's numbers.

To be fair. Webex Teams looks  similar to slack. Well there might be performance or other issues which doesn't matter much for a communication platform (chat) and there is some inherent trust $CSCO will not monetize or leak data.

Correct. The Webex Teams (more in line with Slack) software however not as refined as Slack or MSFT Teams yet. But definitely, it will becomes $CSCO priority soon.

Yep. Own $CSCO and $ORCL since the dot com days. Both now pay a nice dividend. Became Oracle shareholder when they acquired Siebel Systems. Good examples why a long term horizon is crucial. Confident that 1-2 stocks in my portfolio can take a similar journey in the next decade.

Growth plus yield: $MSFT, $AAPL, $CSCO, $INTC. Best ETFs are $IGV or $VGT. Avoid companies with high capex.

Good eye Lukas! Here's the daily $CSCO 1990 vs $DDOG.  Smaller base on the left, then breakout, but bear market (1990 Nasdaq 33.77% deep vs 2020 Nasdaq 32.6%  - close!!!) took both down to form a larger base, then after bear market ended, broke out to new high.

Great find! Thx!

Ladies and Gents - if you have smaller accounts, it doesn’t automatically mean you have to always play weeklies and biweeklies because they cost cheaper.

There are perfectly good near the money plays or just OTM plays 1-3 months out for under $2 a contract. 

BUILD your account.

I would have never bought $CSCO then in my own accounts; fortunately I had been ""inoculated"" in value investing in the early 1990s, so I avoided virtually every dot-com stock during the late 1990s.  Was painful between 1996-2000, but owning value paid off insanely in 2001-04. 2/n

I am going to side with $CSCO. They have transitioned to a strong recurring revenue model that will continue to grow in the years to come, plus they pay over a 3% dividend. 

Outside the dividend world I am going to go with $WORK. I think this will continue to be the future.

Sold Microsoft at $51 in 2000. It never recovered for 14 YEARS. During which time you could've doubled your money in bonds. 

So $MSFT is more risk and less return than $JNK since then.

In the .com bust of 2000, $CSCO was my prize holding. I thought where could they ever go & I was right, you think their earnings are important 20 years later? BUT, if you bought $CSCO in 2000 at $80-$90 you are still waiting for another 25% to get even again!

Adding to the initial analysis, good products don’t always come from good companies. And good companies often do not have good stocks.

Look at $FIT or $UA or TiVo in consumer, or $CSCO in B2B as examples.

It's a generational thing. If people are being introduced to $ZM esp kids who go to school/uni, they'll stick with it. Even if their companies are using $CSCO as defacto enterprise software, their meetings outside the meeting room would be on Zoom.

Best of luck to you. Differences of opinion are what makes the market work. I believe the $MSFT freight train will ultimately win out here. I know my company has strictly told us we can’t use $ZM. They are driving us toward using MS Teams and away from $CSCO webex.

I'm being generous to $TSLA comparing it to $CSCO. I just hope it is not $JDSU. A lot of people believe it is like $AMZN. I don't see it that way. Car making is way more capital intensive. $TSLA has yet to produce consistent profit if you exclude emission credit profit.

This is my daily struggle =) Does $INTC turn-around? What about $CSCO? $CSGS, $YELP, $NTAP the list goes on.

Using a more quality/value screen has helped me behaviorally as well (Additional margin of safety).

But the ultimate win is still the same. Multiple expansion.

Other than $SHOP none come anywhere close to market cap of $ZM. $ZM is also pretty close to $CSCO market cap. Why & how $ZM can achieve this growth going forward based on one product? IMO they had right product at the right time but easy growth is likely over & the grind begins.

Isso me lembra:
You can lose money in a good business if you overpay.

$CSCO doubled revenues and gross profits from 2000-10.

The stock was flat from 2000-10 with a 86% drawdown. Why? Multiple compression. Price/sales went from 6x to 3x.

It’s not enough to buy a great business.

Did a deep dive on $CSCO today. 

Projected sales at 2.3%, EPS at  2.1%

I come to a buy price of $37.00 
The annualized rate of return between 3.8% and 6.2%. 

I will watch for a dip but think this is a solid company, with a good dividend.

1) I was long, sold my $fsly shares at 94.07
2) this is a false rumor imo to hit the 20% short interest. $csco stock didnt even move & still up & u better believe it would’ve fallen if ppl thought they about to pay 30-35x sales for $fsly. That tells me theres no truth here

Yes it would be very expensive and with good reason, the company itself is quite healthy (despite a bit of a wild ride in the market). You would have to come to the table with something crazy and that doesn’t strike me as $csco style

Even with the tax benefits + participation in the synergies that comes with accepting stock, I can easily see $FSLY management asking for much more than 60% cash at a higher valuation as $CSCO shares aren't very appealing. Unsure if the synergies justify a massive premium....

Makes a lot of sense 
@JonahLupton
 - I can see why it would benefit Cisco.

The thing is that $FSLY does routing differently and my understanding is their offering means less need for routers

So $CSCO might be having to cannibalise itself to catch up

Traders and speculators start coming into stocks that have the possibility of short term gains. 

$FSLY long term shareholders are holding and hoping it not to be true. I guess if it happens, they will move to $NET and not own $CSCO.

But hey, that's just my feeling.

It would not be a replay of $LVGO and $TDOC because that was mostly an all stock deal with two much smaller and more volatile stocks. 

$CSCO’s deal would probably be at least 50% cash and even if $CSCO dropped 5% on the news the premium would more than make up for that.

I was working as an engineer at $CSCO during dotcom. On 3/31/00, it was $81. Rev was $19B. 
3/2001 $CSCO Was $12.77, Rev was $206B. 
This was not a dotcom co. Solid rev and growth. 

2020, Rev is $49B. Stock is at $44.

If we look into $CSCO acquisition history, they were always willing to add good ones to their portfolio. That said it takes time for most to evolve. Their hardware heavy focus in the past has not given them a easy transition towards SAAS.

What is a ""company you'll love holding"" though? There are sufficient companies ( $AKAM, $JNPR, $CSCO ) that have grown revenue and profits 8X since 2000 and their stock price has gone to 1/10th of 2000. They all have 100%+ revenue growth years, terrific mgmt, etc.

$IBM $INTC $ORCL $CSCO and a few others still feel like the legacy companies that haven’t been able to find any true growth acceleration in the past decade as the smaller, VC backed companies come public and gobble up their market share.

I would have said 5-10% and that’s probably being optimistic. It would be a huge move to go buy a company for 30x 2021 sales although $CSCO clearly as the horsepower to accelerate $FSLY growth.

Understandably. I remember thinking similarly about $CSCO prior to dot com bust. No idea what happens next, but too often I've seen big winners lag /lose bc of pulled forward expectations. Its stilla big position for me, but pruning the tree seems prudent to me.

Just a friendly reminder that at $680 per share, $TSLA sports a fully diluted market cap of $822 billion, or about 28x TTM sales. The main financial sites like Yahoo are ignoring ~260M of shares outstanding from Options, RSUs and the recent offering.
