Just my 2 cents if I may add: $HDB can be a bigger position since it‚Äôs not only largest and best run bank in India, but also it‚Äôs better managed or as well managed as $JPM + I think many underestimate the potential of a $100Bn+ co. in India. 

Now, valuation is a different thing.

Although I know $TSLA will be my best long term stock out of my portfolio. I hedge it by buying stocks like $COST and $JPM. I sold my other stocks to pick up more TSLA near $185. It paid off because I believe. When opportunity comes, I need to make sacrifices to get more TSLA.

My 2nd trade was also orb trade. I saw $bac ans $jpm moving hard off the lows, $bac was the 1st one to take out HOD, so i took it at 11:45 candle and sold on 12:00 candle for a nice gain, but finished the day flat. I was ready to dump bac if it took out 11;45 low.

A Reason to 'Chase'
CEO Jamie Dimon is back and the firm is in good shape, even if times are rough, so I plan to add on weakness.

Carl's quoting JP Morgan the brokerage for their clients- as for $JPM, Dimon said there'll be a bad recession, GDP could fall 35%, unemployment can hit 14%, JPM's earnings/revs will be down significantly, and they may even cut the dividend. That is more realistic

Interesting, $JPM reports Tuesday the 14th, and we already heard Dimon predict bad recession.  So how will they handle forward guidance - pretend he never said that and predict blue skies and V shaped explosion? Or admit he was right and predict gloom and doom?  What a dilemma!!

JPMorgan Halts ALL Non-Govt Guaranteed Loans.

Non-Guaranteed loans are the highest profit center business for the banks...high interest...rarely default.

Only reason for JPM to cut off this business...is if they expect an avalanche of loan defaults in the near future.

Boom.

Good points on this thread. 13% sounds reasonable though I am guessing 16%. Pre-Covid mgmt target was 17% & $JPM was doing low-to-mid-teens quite consistently even before 2017 US tax cuts. Clearly it would depend on severity of downturn & how long ""free"" money from the Fed lasts.

I bought $JPM this week when it went below 89$, and I'm ready to start cost averaging when it dips more.

Yeah, it's a bit overpriced now, but can't complain, it's a super company, a dividend aristocrat too!

10% per year return seems alright.  Perhaps you have a different view of rates?
$JPM has $9.75 normalized EPS in two years, trades 9X that number has a ton of PPNR to cover credit losses and should probably trade closer to 12-13X - easily a $125 stock in two yrs +40%

Dividend cuts and suspensions will occur as a way to stay politically neutral while the fallout settles.

A few banks levered in oil probably get swallowed up.

$JPM owns the government so they're dictating this policy and will take minimal funds so they can pay their divs.

Thank you - they changed up the topics a bit based on news flow. Looking for more $MSFT this week. Possibly $AK stock (I love that 
@WarrenBuffett
 bailed because it creates better entries). Watching $V and $JPM carefully for dips.

Disclosures - I own and family owns

$BAC is one of my biggest positions. Then $C. Then $JPM.  JP is the slowest mover out of those from what I have been watching.

Here's something else that will shatter the faith in the Fed: banks. The Fed is loosening while the big banks borrowing from them are tightening. That's a recipe for disaster. $JPM and $WFC eliminated HELOCs and went to 20% down, 700 CS on all mortgages and refi's. Others coming.

$BAC $XLF and $JPM are on TRM sells, and $C is on a hold. But there's really no momentum, as the 20ema is basically just flat and been going sideways... So no trade on any of these for me, but definitely doesn't look good.

It looks like Cash App hit 40 million MAUs.

SensorTower (data source) was pretty close to Cash App's disclosed MAUs of 24M in December 2019.

Tesla: Don't Buy The Stock, Or The Car (NASDAQ:TSLA)
Comparing Tesla to its closest peers, it becomes quite clear that Tesla is trading at a quite high valuation. Tesla is not a tech company and should not be valued like one.

Personally did okay by buying $GS $MS at the March lows. Bought $JPM $WFC & the story has to unfold. That said banks are structurally challenged with the rise of fintech $SQ $PYPL etc. Legacy providers have been stodgy & the new players will eat the legacy lunch piece by piece.

I agree, big banks are going fintech.

You can certainly see the results with $BAC and $JPM.

Don't really know $C.

I know you like $WFC, Bill, but I do wonder if they're too distracted to tackle tech in a meaningful way and if they'll get too far behind everyone else.

I have ten shares in $JPM and I‚Äôm never going to sell it. Unless the business fundamentally changes. 

Honestly I think $DFS is a better move than buying $JPM. But if you want a more traditional bank then go for it.

I have zero sympathy for any retail money chasing the market at these levels. 

Jamie Dimon himself was somber in $JPM's earnings report.

Jerome Powell gave a downbeat outlook.

The economic data isn't getting better.

But sure, use rent money to buy meme stocks.

Initiated a position on $JPM one day before earnings.

Started buying at $100.29.

Latest purchase at $87.37.

Current cost basis at $93.98 with a yield of 3.83%

A buy at current price of $87.24 will yield over 4%. 

Will  slowly keep adding at these prices.

Great company to be sure but here's my logic ... people can look for gold with $HD or $LOW but I'd rather go after the picks and shovels they'll use to fix up their homes a la $JPM or $V for example. #Retail comes and goes but #money always gets spent.

Does that make sense?

SELL. The Bank had plenty of problems before the covid-19 and now it's just getting worst.

I'm not a big fan of U.S. Banks (I'm Canadian, so I can pick the best of the breed here). 

If I have to buy one in the U.S., it would be $JPM.
My favourite are $RY.TO and $NA.TO

$JPM is cheap from a valuation perspective and has plenty of room to the upside. That one I really like it. One of my top rated in financials. That's the trade I'm in for the long haul. I see some value in $AXP. I'm underweight $WBA, I'm long $CVS.

October brings new ATH's, maybe more than 1.
No matter who wins election we will be trading in a range.
Next large sell off is week of Thanksgiving.

Or I could be totally wrong. Time will tell.

Regardless, on a relative basis, $XLF is hated just as much as it was during the GFC. Is it a prelude to a new uptrend? Depends on which way the 30 year breaks, IMO. Track $JPM , for example, with the 30 year and it tells an interesting story.

$JPM is the custodian of the $SLV ETF & it's questionable whether the metal is there

$PSLV is operated by Sprott, is fully backed & there is provision for shares to be redeemed for metal in some cases.

$PSLV often commands a premium in times of supply tightness

for clarity, $JPM is already a client and $NEWU is rolling out with them.  JPM brought NEWU to the Haven trial which includes $AMZN and $BRK.A  JPM will likely continue regardless of what happens with Haven.  Would be a big win if AMZN and BRK become clients after the trial

The market rally over the last 4, 8, 12 years is largely due to innovation, profit growth and low rates. $AMZN $AAPL $FB $GOOG $MSFT profits are up 5-10x since 2016 so their stocks deserve to be higher. Same for $HD $COST $TGT $JPM. These companies would have dominated anyway.

W/ $350B+ market cap now, I see a future where $JPM can reach $1T in the next 10yrs, far from certainty. I think we see more consolidation in space, w/ big banks winning, regional banks losing. Actually talk about that very thing w/

100% agreed. If you‚Äôre looking to hear more large cap PM‚Äôs pound the table on $SBUX $MCD and $JPM then CNBC is better for them. If you want to crush the indexes then our shows are probably better for them.

I did for a long time, but finally got rid of it. But I like both $JPM and $BAC, they're both doing a lot of things right. Again, not saying it's likely or probable that $JPM gets there, just that it's possible.

$SQ is the other horse in onboarding nocoiners.
@ARKInvest
 recently put out a $375 price target by 2025 with the assumption SQ can monetize 20-40% of MAUs siphoned from $JPM, $BAC, $WFC.

$BTC today, $ETH soon?

One stock I think is underrated going into 2021.

$JPM - JP Morgan Chase.

Why?
- Government backed.
- Biggest bank in the US.
- Strong CEO, Jamie Dimon.
- Safe dividend (approx 3%)
- Low Wall Street expectations.

*Not investing advice.
