I'm surprised why you're running os/2 2.x. It uses more RAM, and had the SIQ issue. 
Best OS/2 was Warp Connect (1995).
(OS/2 Warp 3.x w NETBIOS)
+ last fixpak (fp44 if memory doesn't betray me). 
Or if you want the latest greatest, go for Warp 4.52 CP2 (2001 or thereabouts)

My point before to 
@rwang0
 was that research won’t save 
@IBM
. The young talent is flocking to firms like 
@Google
. IBM is only relevant to its current customer base which is shrinking. Redhat deal was a #hail Mary. #cloud reality

I’m with @rwang0 - Google has the cash pile and resources for a long fight. It was behind kubernetes and has developer backing. IBM emptied the coffers on the Redhat acquisition and while its research is good it has little relevance outside its current client base. #cloud reality

Will

Of the customers I have worked with, there are pros and cons to commercial & open source software. Depending on the situation, one approach may serve better than the other. But there is still a heavy reliance on commercial software from the enterprise perspective.

I personally think IBM has lost the plot in #CloudComputing.  Out of ~350 students, the split of cloud computing in real use is roughly 60% Microsoft and 40% AWS.  I had 2 Oracle guys using....Oracle....and then 2 people playing with Google.  Even my IBM people don't use IBM...

I think IBM has put effort into the dev community, the issue I is still that they have to break the paradigm associated w/working w/IBM. Efforts are mainly to hold on to existing custs & aren’t successful in finding new. Chg’g how custs perceive working w/them is key

My understanding is they are using Flickr 
@creativecommons
 photos, but it's unclear which CC license they are using photos from, and certainly attribution, which is required for almost all, is not given. So 
@IBM

WTF? None of this is normal. We have a presidiot that incites violence but speaks out against terrorists in other countries. Then his base feels entitled to tweet this in a public forum. Yes, we can report and block, but that just means we don’t see it. Doesn’t stop the behavior

Blood Bath at Oracle:  Mass layoffs. Oracle laying off 10% of its' global workforce the message everything revolves around the cloud.

 is broken - it’s a biz after all & you can’t poke sticks at them for that. Yes they could have done better in some ways but at the end of the day so could all other major players out there - incl AWS whose costs are becoming apparent to public

Oracle is still reparable; it will stay repairable for next few years; having said that, sooner it can repaired, cheaper the repair cost will be!

Few big punches with their public cloud “done right” (business model + developer friendly product) will change the market narrative!

i wonder if most of the cash was held offshore (tax efficient) and then post-trump brought onshore; buybacks then make at least some sense. Interest payments offset tax so debt not terrible. “What the other guys are doing” not enough of a plan though, as you say

Until

 fundamentally reforms how its sales teams are rewarded this change won’t happen. Licence lock in plays will make their job harder. It is not that there are bad people there, there aren’t but people will behave in ways that incentivise behaviour.

Isn’t it interesting how over the past 50 years our technology has gotten exponentially better but man hasn’t gone to the moon in 47 years.

And no one from any other country has ever been to the moon, even though the technology has gotten better.

Just something to point out...

IBM has been like this for a decade.  

They pretend they are gonna use any new tech. 

But they are not a tech company anymore.  

They are in the business of keeping their legacy shareholders happy.

When I read it first time, was intensely thought provoking. Yet simple analogy for those who have the substance and eagerness to understand. In all fairness to me, your first line actually sums it up! ( Despite a perennially evolving definition, ‘DevOps’ is all about integration)

This is a great article, thanks Sally. IMO #DevOps should simply be secure by design and the industry shouldn’t need to be differentiating DevOps and #SecDevOps, whilst this is requisite in our #Cybersecurity landscape I realise that it’s currently a utopian view #gettingthere!

A nice piece Sally. From my experience developers need to be less siloed as a “everyone does their bit” type of approach happens and multiple team engagement doesn’t happen. All what you mention are great points and should be taken on board!

Excellent write up, Sally! I love how #DevOps helps companies overcome silos and transit teams from being ""department-focused"" to ""organization-focused"" which ultimately leads them to become customer-centric companies. 

I look forward to what you bring up next in the series :)

19% of all CS grads are Black and Latinx and that number has been between 15 and 22% for at least a decade. But SF/SV is 3% and across country it is 9%. I also just saw some research that said for Latinas, only 25% of those grads are hired.

I would also say there is currently a gap between the trained workforce and who is allowed in. You have a labor crisis and we don't even take the current available talent if it doesn't come with a pedigree. People need new skills, but so do the companies.

@IBM
 is a #B2B company, which already indicates we have different interests from #B2C companies.

As far as #UK versus #US goes, I'd rather compare #Europe versus #US. With #GDPR Europe clearly took a different stance, albeit this is slowly changing in the US as well.

And if you *do* want such a free-for-all, just have people burn money instead of voting with tokens.  Whichever choice had more people burn money on it = better.  Don't try to do anything fancy and redistribute the output either, that's probably just going to distort incentives.

Do you want it in your permissionless crypto protocol?  Probably not. Because there is law governing shareholder vote buying/sales. In a permissionless model, the buying/selling is hard to constrain from a free-for-all. You probably don't want a free-for-all in your protocol.

An  engineer once made a decision that cost IBM 10 million dollars. He was soon summoned by founder Tom Watson Sr.
Upon entering he said, “Well I suppose you want my resignation”
""You can’t be serious!"" Mr Watson exclaimed, ""We just spent 10 million dollars educating you!""

When I left MSFT in 2000 stock was at $35.20 split adjusted, now at $137.21.  Market cap in 2000 was $358b, now $1.057T.  Shares o/s then was 10.6b, now 7.7b.  So some of stock price increase b/c of buybacks, but most b/c of creating real value

No argument here that the kube/container ecosystem has one of the longer roads ahead in this space. That shouldn't discount the huge amount of work that's happened on the systemd, kernel, and distro side.

Agreed.  GloFo has given up on < 14nm for economic reasons, there were articles in the press on that a year or so ago.  Only a select few foundries are pushing lower than 14nm -- Moore's law is just about dead.  ""Exciting"" times ahead for sure!

No. Such technology in fact had generally no role in the Holocaust. SS-WVHA made some attempts to steer prisoner deployment in the concentration camp system using Hollerith machines in 1944, but this technology was in fact very quickly abandoned.
