Yes, IBM seems like a good example. The mere fact that it isn't always perfect doesn't mean that it counts as ethics washing. For ethics washing, the code of ethics is devised *primarily in order to* provide a show of good practice.

It’s not too little, it might be little too late! 

Seriously, IBM lost good 3-4 years even after they knew how important #cloud posture was.

Let’s hope they prioritize investments in required areas. Their marketing narrative is tilted too much towards Ops, they ignored devs.

A HUGE part of the reason that

The second wave of unemployment among white collar workers continues to build. Silicon Valley, @Dell & now @IBM 

As detailed this week @Quillintel the silent wave is pulled job openings. The first wave is directly tied to COVID-19 affected industries.

I remeber the first time IBM did layoffs. I believe it was 1985. And it was the last company left to use it as a tool to manage expense. Up until then, sales could always support staff. About 5 years after the pc.

You act like this is something new. People have always been hired based on skills. Talk about grabbing low hanging fruit and then acting like you had to climb unaided to the top of a coconut tree to get some nourishment. This pointless window dressing is laughable.

Fantastic writeup. I love the fact that this is all evidence-based. It's almost unreal how undervalued the $VIDT token still is, compared to its obvious potential. Top 50 is somehow still 15x from here. More people are discovering it every day, though, which is great to see.

I don't talk much about my work because I am criticized a lot externally for working at IBM. But people know very little how much interesting stuff we do. It is unfortunate that you have to control yourself and not share the cool things you are working on.

Oracle, IBM ultimately see customers differently, leading to different strategies (IMHO). IBM assumes old technology anchors, requires incremental modernization. Oracle assumes old tech as sedimentary layer but wants to encourage new life to skitter agilely over the bedrock.

It frustrates me when I think about how many of the concepts we worked on @ #servicemesh were just ahead of their time. I wish we were acquired by a firm that had the vision to accelerate what we tried to do. We had agnostic app blueprints in 2012 / 2013 that worked.

Some of my friends from #CommerceOne started Gravitant (cloud brokerage), later sold to IBM as a cloud marketplace. They did a lot of work with Texas public sector. Cloud brokerage never took off.

If you want a game related job, Montreal has a ton of those! Big, medium, small or indie game studios, you pick! And also non game related stuff like matrox, CAE 
 (yes yes, depending on the company you might need some French, but it's not strictly required to work in Montreal )

So, it's like the Apple, Microsoft argument.

Microsoft allowed many manufacturers to build PCs and other hardware. 

With high standards, Apple built its hardware and trail-blazed with the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV+, Arcade, etc. 

Pro tip: Ripple is Apple.

FDR & #EISENHOWER redistributed the wealth painlessly by taxing the millionaire class ... creating the largest middle-class our country's history. Nobody got hurt. Now we have billionaires with so many millions that it's an easy answer they should pay their #FairShare .

Ripple is a lone company while Stellar is a network. There are MANY companies building on #Stellar, like 
@IBM
, 
@FTI_Global
, 
@Securrency
, 
@lightnetgroup
 and more. WorldWire and Lightnet are competing with Ripple, but Stellar isn’t.

I seem to recall that IBM soft-did this ""split"" (excessive messaging abt cloud solutions, that came after softlayer M&A) over 5 years ago - which is indeed when it SHOULD have happened. They would be better off now had they done it then. 

But I guess better late than never...

... and then you have to hope that the execution was solving for the right problem. There’s such a lack of systems awareness in many large organizations that the intent - and the actions - can be severe AND they don’t solve the actual problem. Beware “false fails” and bad cures.

Most Companies who assisted the Nazis in WW2, apologized, accepted guilt & paid compensation.

Not @IBM

Under no duress, they helped track & arrange transport for Jews, Romany & others to Concentration Camps.

They paid £3m & still accept no guilt.

Good points made by all. My take:

- #Edge anything that's an endpoint, purpose-built or not. But we tend to mean the former.

- #DC is any aggregated shared resource in the #cloud. Is global, regional, private, public, even #edge. Mini-DC really becoming a thing. #5G DCs too.

This really is a sticking point for most, but the easy answer is still that; Edge is an independent opportunity space. #Datacenters (on-premises) and public #cloud are potential benefactors of some edge data but are otherwise different ecosystems.
