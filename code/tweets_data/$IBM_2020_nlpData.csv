Yes, IBM seems like a good example. The mere fact that it isn't always perfect doesn't mean that it counts as ethics washing. For ethics washing, the code of ethics is devised *primarily in order to* provide a show of good practice.

There are frustrated maintainers? [citation needed]

The noise all comes from outside the project. A lot of people who don‚Äôt contribute and don‚Äôt use it have opinions.

You and I know the CNCF has nothing to do with governance. That nuance is lost in the squabble‚Ä¶

A HUGE part of the reason that 
@Linkerd
 is so much faster and smaller than Istio is because of linkerd2-proxy. Envoy is great but it's a general-purpose proxy. Swiss army knife when you need a needle. linkerd2-proxy us avoid a huge amount of complexity

I don't talk much about my work because I am criticized a lot externally for working at IBM. But people know very little how much interesting stuff we do. It is unfortunate that you have to control yourself and not share the cool things you are working on.

The fact that it isn‚Äôt clear says it all

IBM hasn‚Äôt been able to build a winning #cloud business so far

Even when unshackled from the declining business lines and even with

Most Companies who assisted the Nazis in WW2, apologized, accepted guilt & paid compensation.

Not @IBM

Under no duress, they helped track & arrange transport for Jews, Romany & others to Concentration Camps.

They paid ¬£3m & still accept no guilt.

Good points made by all. My take:

- #Edge anything that's an endpoint, purpose-built or not. But we tend to mean the former.

- #DC is any aggregated shared resource in the #cloud. Is global, regional, private, public, even #edge. Mini-DC really becoming a thing. #5G DCs too.

This really is a sticking point for most, but the easy answer is still that; Edge is an independent opportunity space. #Datacenters (on-premises) and public #cloud are potential benefactors of some edge data but are otherwise different ecosystems.
