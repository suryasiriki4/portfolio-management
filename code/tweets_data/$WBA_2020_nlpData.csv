Fans must be returned to the heart of #cafc & help rebuild our great, historic club.

Let’s work to begin the new era with a capacity crowd, in the game following the sale, celebrating we’ve got our #cafc back.

So refreshing to here this... shows how hard he is really working and shows how he understands that’s it’s not going to be easy to get in the side. Massive future ahead of him. Should be on the bench at the weekend at least for me.

Seven Championship clubs charging away fans more than any Premier League side.

The third-best attended league in Europe is in danger of being left behind as away fans are charged high prices.

Yes, can see wholesale changes next summer, assume Barry will retire, and brunt may play on for a season or two lower down the league. I wouldn't even consider signing Krov permanently as he is far too lightweight and negative in his play.

I personally though Sawyers was great in the second half, dropped deeper to collect the ball off Hegazi and Bartley so we weren't just passing along the back 4 all match. 
I just want to see more movement to create a passing option from our midfield, that's what'll get us upfield

We were so slow it was incredibly frustrating. The amount of times we had wingers out wide in space but we took 3 or 4 unnecessary touches and the space was gone. 

We created 2 chances all game, Cardiff created nothing but scored twice from our mistakes. Absolute shambles.

The bloke is so frustrating to watch.Has pace to burn gets his fair share of goals for a winger and loads of assists,But can be moody doesn't track back and his final ball let's him down.For the wages he was on and his age it's probably best to move him on

There is a HUGE Polish community close to WBA..
Fully embraced Krychowiak, but whether him, Pulis or Pardew, never quite gelled...
And a pretty expensive mistake..
I saw Grosicki last season when I was back in England.., v Hull, really impressed...

Hi Jamie a tough day I know, Kamil and Jarrod have been very important for the team over the past few seasons. I’m sure you’re with me on this and wish them well in their futures. New players will arrive. Keep getting behind Grant and the Team. UTT Best regards Nigel

Not promoted or should we even start tempting fate until there is a (P) next to our name. Work hard, support the players, let's get it done. But it's nowhere near a certainty even with a potential 9 point lead.

The way we handled his departure was piss poor. The club constantly promising him a new contract at the end of the season so they could run it down and release him. Did the same to boaz. Piss poor.

Maltese Albion fan here - an excellent loan signing. Soule is an all-rounder up front. An opportunity for him to play a part in your historical return to the Football League P.S. I've been to Barrow in 1993 - I remember those nuclear submarines, and the long journey there!

How insecure do you have to be to find young lads on the internet and try to bully them about their haircut? Or looks, or about something they're trying to do?

I sit in E32 and if you’re lad and you were wearing glasses then you managed to keep quiet for first 2 goals so why couldn’t you for the third. You have to remain respectful of others and not celebrate in home end. No mention of city fans who came to your aid then??

Sam Johnstone is the reason we didn't lose 3-0. The reason we lost was that we didn't show the same fight and aggression to win the ball as we have the rest of this month. Wigan wanted it more because they have to fight. We played like we were waiting for the win to happen.

No. I just can't stand them. And I'm not sure Villa success serves Albion well. Would simply soak up more support for them. 3 miles separate the 2 clubs. It's one of the oldest rivalries in football.

As an #lufc fan, I don’t believe Casilla should play for the club again and the way the club and the FA have handled this, is a disgrace. Racism has no place in society never mind the football field. Have to feel for Leko in all this.

The brilliant gesture Albion have made that will make fans proud

I’d urge you to do so, then consider whether your allegation of scaremongering is fair.

You’ve missed an important distinction: WBA confirmed he was not tested for Covid-19. For those who display symptoms the priority is to self-isolate. Charlie AusTin was at family home at the time, far from WBA training ground. Baffled by your ‘scaremongering’ allegation

I’d never really been in to football, and all my cousins are West Ham fans. This was the first match my grandad took me to, just him and I.
I’d never seen him cry before, I asked why he was. He said “I never thought I’d be able to take one of grandchildren to the Albion”. Magic.

After 14 yrs @WBA I finally say goodbye. Loved every minute. Met & worked with some excellent people. I’d like to thank young players & parents for choosing @WBA but mostly to our team of dedicated academy scouts. They are the secret to our success. It has been my pleasure guys.

Best fans I’ve seen at Valley Parade - no question! Crowd was over 20,000 that day. We allocated them just under 3,000; there must of been a further 2,000 in the home ends. The game was shown on ITV Digital - a platform that would later cripple us financially.

I'm a Baggies fan and got mine last year. They sold out so quick they couldn't keep up with demand at the club shop. Ordered more and sold out instantly. First season in a while going back to the classic yellow and green which is special to us since 2003. Hence the crazy sales

I'll tell you, the lack of hunting has affected me in the strangest of ways, some of the dreams i've had have been.. interesting.
Especially the one where i found an early 90's Leicester shirt and late 80's Liverpool....

Always gives himself time on the ball and that’s a sign of a good player and he reads the game well too. Our fans love a headless chicken who dives into a challenge or looks like they are chasing shadows. Some don’t know ballers when they see one  Sawyers is definitely a baller

The core of the great mid / late 70’s side here (Big John Wile, Ally Brown, Alistair Robertson, Len Cantello) and Asa Hartford, too good to have gone down - looks like John McAule and Bobby Gould as well in shot - I hope my early 70s knowledge has not let me down here!!!???

Completely deserved the win that afternoon, too.  Best memory of that day though was Tom Davies scoring for Everton in the 96th min to equalise v Southampton and give us a fighting chance of staying up.

Managers like players, go over the hill. Saunders wasn't the best at Blues, he was completely shot by the time we employed him. Whatever he did right at Villa, he didn't do it at The Albion. The club was in sharp decline at the time, and he couldn't stop it for whatever reason.

The thing about this fella . Teamed up with Astle in the 60s      . And Regis in the 70s        ..  unique with two of the clubs Legends. . What Status does it give Tony Brown . . I don’t think there’s never going to be another like him to be honest. Bomber Brown.

What an amazing day that was - other than the sad news that was to befall you later.
2o'clock kick off and sitting on a bench along the touchline on that remarkable day was only bettered by th tea at your Nan's afterwards.

Reckon you should offer the option of full refund or for a small % of the refund to be donated directly to charity.

Many would take up the latter option.

Went to the City Ground on a bus from the Gatehouse 

Predictably missed the kick off

A copper on the gate took great delight in telling us of Taylor's red card..

Forest fans pelting us with coins
That goofy toothed tosser thinking he had scored

Stone Roses all the way home.

Top goalscorer. I never met him, sadly. My mate Jamie was brother of Coventry City player Greg Downs and got me the boots via him. 
I've only ever heard great things about Cyrille's generosity. RIP.

Spot on. Those going for Gera are either too young or are appreciating Gera’s service. Which is fine but Koumas was a magician who played in a poorer team than Gera did most of the time.

I have to say he’s probably the best manager I’ve seen us have in a long time the football is fun and entertaining the players seem to love it and we seem to have that fire back in the fan base and I can see him taking us to be a comfortable premier league team next year

above us anyway. They're a good side but they're no better than us so there's no reason why we can't finish above them. And I also think with our superior fitness we'll more than likely be the team who hits the ground running. Get at least a draw against Fulham is the main thing.

To be fair this time last year we were fighting it out with Sheff Utd for 2nd, Fulham aren't on Sheff Utd's level. It's not that it's done and dusted but I'd be very confident once it resumes especially with their run of games compared to ours.

The BRE would be class if we could make it like some clubs do on the continent. I’m not talking ‘ultra’, just allowed to make an atmosphere. Smethwick Enders will say BRE is shite. Truth is, neither are what they once were. Safe standing and possibly a shuffle of the stands

Completely agree. His first season was probably the best I had ever seen West Ham, the first season at London Stadium was always going to be hard but felt like he was hung out to dry.

Agreed - have watched them keenly this year, and they’re doing a great job.

I’m sure he’d be the first to admit he made mistakes that second season - showed too much loyalty if anything and was taken advantage of - but what he’s done at WBA shows it wasn’t just down to Payet!

New West Brom contracts are a big boost for Slaven Bilic
Slaven Bilic is thrilled Chris Brunt, Gareth Barry, Lee Peltier and Jonathan Bond have committed themselves to Albion until the end of the season.

It wasn't Orient, as a club, who erected the statue.   Poor Laurie died at the age of just 33 - and he is an iconic player in our history - fact.    What really annoys me, is that #LOFC - as a club - have NEVER honoured Sir Peter Allen - our all time appearance record holder.

Our most important win of the season, solid in defence, Hegazi and O'Shea were superb, greater tempo in midfield, once the game opened up, and huge confidence boosts up front..
Periera needed a confidence booster and truly got it..

The distances those boys have to travel is not good. Does it really matter in the big scale of things. Surely regular competitive football as well as unhindered home/social life is just as important? Some Sunday’s leave house at 7am and return after 6pm. That can’t be good?

No denying Pereira -  8 goals and 16 assists - is a quality attacking midfielder Nigel

But Benrahma on the left wing - 17 goals & 8 assists

It was embarrassing anyway, a proper dinglesque thing to do. I wouldn't mind but it was to make the players feel like were behind them when really there was about 5 scarves on the bridge. Embarrassing really. Could understand if the whole bridge was draped.

2622 attempted passes 90% pass completion across a season.

My great uncle told me that his dad (my great grandfather) took two oranges to that match for half time. It was so packed in the B’ham Rd End he couldn’t lift his arms up to get the oranges out of his pockets and he could feel the juice running down his legs during the match.

Many thanks to @ChapmanJ92 for lending me his thoughts on #CTFC's new #WBA loanee Finn Azaz:

""Big, bulky, not easily shrugged off the ball. Reminds me ever so slightly of George Thorne in that sense."" 

Will offer something different then to Chris Clements or Conor Thomas.

Will be our 82nd season in top flight out of 123 in total - exactly 2/3. Only 10 teams in English football have spent longer in the top division. None of Wolves, Sheff W, West Ham, Stoke, Blues, Leeds, Forest or Leicester have managed more than 66. Not bad for a small town. #wba

I think 8s about right tbf, lots of our fans seem to think that numbers closer to 20. It's not an urgent issue and I think he could do better when there aren't as many crosses being swung in

You are probably correct Conrad, but we tend to do all our work ( other than in the disastrous years of Williams et al) outside of the media’s reach. I expect any news around our activity to be agent lead and probably very little truth in those stories.

Mitro Watkins is 50/50 and just personal preference. Raya is a tough one probably made too many mistakes to be there but conceded the least of anyone over the normal season. Possibly bialkowski or rodak instead of him

Maybe so. I counted 8 goals through the season that I directly blamed him for, not including ones where he failed to command his area etc, he’s low down on the list of issues and will hopefully do ok but I’m yet to be convinced

@wba family...

Looking for a big favour...

My Nan passed away yesterday and her last present to me and my little boy was a top with 4 @RobsonKanu on the back...

I want to get them signed and framed as a reminder for him when he grows up...

Can anyone help?

Why did you block the #NUFCTakeover ? Hope it wasn’t because you favour a country that funds terrorism? 

Or was your new chairman Gary Hoffman doing his Barclays pals or a certain BeIN anchor a favour?

To be honest he should have been replaced the day after we stayed up against Blackburn, he had taken the club as far as he could, but Morgan showed too much blind faith in McCarthy and it came back to bite him 6 months later.

As a liverpool fan,I would say that Everton got one of the best midfield set ups in the league, the core of Allan,Dou,Gomez,and James totally amazing to watch going forward, and solid defensively.

 not many teams will be getting any let alone taking points away from Chelsea outside the top 6. There’s positive signs going into the games against Southampton, Burnley, Brighton and Fulham. #wba

Well played, that was a great match but we should’ve won, it feels like a loss after we took the game to Chelsea in the first half.
How that wasn’t ruled out for handball I’ll never know but we can’t keep conceding so many goals.
A lot of positives but that’s 2 points lost.

Honestly, I can’t see where our threat is going to come from this season. Sawyers, Townsend, O’Shea and Livermore are just not premier league level the way we’re playing.
Johnstone and Bartley have had been pretty solid today despite conceding. Pereira and Grady can’t carry us.

People who have no interest in football tend to think those of us who are passionate about it are all Neanderthals. Great that people like this and also Marcus Rashford getting recognition are showing a different side of football.

Seems the Premier League clubs  have forgotten that old adage!

Greedy clubs demonstrating a lack of class. The fans won't forget this mercenary move. Is it really all about the £? 

What about the fans? Forgotten!

I pay more than £100 per month for Sky and BT. I have also bought an early bird season ticket, which you have now transplanted to next season, not knowing whether you can fulfill. Now you want £15 PPV. This is disgraceful. The least you can do is offer ST holders a discount.

Genuinely appalled that we voted for this. You already have my season ticket money for the season ahead (which I did not ask to be refunded by 30/9) and now less than 10 days later you are asking for £15 per game In addition to the money you already have.

I had a restricted view seat for this game. Ticket was about £10. The only restriction was that I was seated above one of the exits so had a metal bar in front of me for safety.

To this day, it was actually the best view I've had at the Hawthorns.

Support Wolverhampton's foodbank and boycott PPV. #CharityNotPPV 

Instead of lining the pockets of the PL & their broadcast partners, lets donate to our local foodback

I've set up an initiative where you can donate.

To access 207 live PL games via Sky and BT currently costs £55 a month (£660 a year). Even if you ignore all the other football competitions and all the other sports included in that price, that's still only £3 a game. £15 is a rip off.

This would have been about the time Alan Shearer was shown around as well (he was introduced to big Cyrille). I guess Bully would have been on the books then as well.  The decline during the 80s was horrendous. Down to the ownership though, not true legends like Nobby - RIP.

The second one, but Gibbs in for Townsend if he's over the little tantrum he had at Everton. Gibbs just offers more I think and he linked up well with Diangana on the few occasions they were both fit last season.

Let’s add, only just got us up after having a 12 point lead. All down to Barnsley and Stoke helping us. 1 win in 13 games and that was against Harrogate. Embarrassing

Totally agree. He has a good squad, but some of his decisions are strange. Really want Bilic to do a good job and believe he can do a great job, but with his static lineup, no plan b, playing players out of position and starting out of form players, I am not sure if he can.

I’d like to disagree. Liverpool were top and we were winning BY A LOT! So we’ve already won this league, and if it wasn’t for spurs cheating and playing a game  and winning today to get three points which puts them top fair and square we’d be champions again.

Superb read, I too was a young Baggie in 1978, slightly younger than Andy, and have vivid memories of listening to that match at home with my dad, the Christmas lights seemed to twinkle even brighter that day. Foolishly, maybe I thought this was how it was always gonna be...

For me 80/81 was the last great season. The great players we had over the 5 years before were never replaced with the same quality. Whether that was a financial decision (probably) or not but by 1988 the club was in trouble on and off the field

My first job out of school was at Barclays on West Brom High Street - clubs bank in those days. Opened Cyrilles first Bank Account for him just after he joined us - brilliant, unassuming but friendly young man. I’d no idea at the time what an immediate impact he’d go on to make.

""All those crucial decisions went against us.""

""For me, the penalty on Conor Gallagher is a clear penalty.""

Slaven Bilić believes his side were hard done by with the decisions made in this evening's game vs Man Utd...

I'm enjoying Bartley's role more and more, was heavily criticised at times in his first season, but never bucks a challenge, and I think the role of Ivanovic can only help as well..
Loved Bartley's Tyson Fury moment last week, felled by a shot, but then sat back up, clear eyed..

We had a better squad the year before and we didn't go up. He inherited a squad that had just lost a strike force that scored 46 goals between them, was forced to bring players in on a shoe string and for 3 quarters of the season looked like we were gonna win the league...

I don’t know how anyone can blame Grant, he’s literally playing off nothing. The reason he’s playing off nothing is we’re so paranoid about our defence we dare not go forward in numbers or too quickly in fear of not being organised at the back and exposed. It’s a mess.

Time for new ownership, right? I mean, clutching the purse strings is not a model to stay up. Clearly this guy's hope was to spend little and see magically the asset increase in value and then sell high. Can't wait to see the bath he rightly takes on the sale, what a fool.

They both scored goals at Championship level but were unproven in the PL. Adams the last 3 seasons average a goal every 3.4 games, Grant every 2.4 games. Lots of similarities and my point was that stepping up to this level is hard, and harder in a poor side, so not all his fault

I'm an Arsenal supporter and someone had suggested that Allardyce was available for our impending relegation battle. I *know* this would never, ever happen, but all the same I'm a bit relieved. Though heartfelt commiserations to Baggies fans. #Boingboing.

Slaven Bilic was a hard-fit footballer. Old school/no nonsense. If he were a racehorse you'd describe him as 'genuine'. I don't think he's always devious enough for some of these boards. Real shame. I hope he finds another position worth his efforts.

As a West Ham fan this is an excellent appointment for West Brom. This guy will get you defensively much more organised and you will play some good football at times too. It’s not all “long ball” as they say. Big Sam is a very good manager and I’m confident he will keep you up

The Morrison appointment is welcome news, and a much needed insight for Allardyce and Lee of squad players, I'm sure that Big Sam is not particularly aware of..

3 of the easiest points we have taken since being back in the premier and that is no exaggeration, the baggies are already in big trouble. Heard a lot of big talk from your fan base after you were promoted but as expected it was all hot air, be a surprise if you escape the drop.

What I loved was that so many people knew about the three of you, although, like me, they didn’t know you personally. It was a real feeling of the Albion family standing to share grief at the loss of one of its own and to support you and Harrison.

They aren't squeezed in. A stand that can hold 12,390 fans in will have 1500. Not sure what you are criticising or why. Every area that is opened requires staff. It'll be costing the club money to open any area at the moment.
