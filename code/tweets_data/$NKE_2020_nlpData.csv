The number of analysts hand waving Coronavirus impact is nuts. As if shutting down stores & supply chains for several weeks won’t impact results. $NKE $SBUX $AAPL $EL $BKNG all at risk with major revenue streams in China. Q1 earnings too high.

I have the complete opposite take, the market is fully aware of severe economic impact coronavirus may have and is presently short squeezing to distribute into higher, ie $NKE upgrades past 2 days to lift 7 pts, then boom AH $NKE announces. $AAPL is a severe risk as is the market

-1% AH move in $NKE implies a ~$1.5B cash-flow impact (assuming the market isn't going to capitalize this event) - NKE will do $4B in FCF total this year on (excl. Coronavirus impact). China represents only ~20% of sales and manufacturing costs. Its a non-event for $NKE shares.

UK stocks cheap here but not always the case as it the point made by Tiho. Can't tell you how many mistakes I have made! I think is important to buy quality companies from US also though. Long $JNJ $MSFT $FB $MA $YUMC $NKE $SBUX as examples from US as can't get by UK exposure.

$UAA gas struggled for growth and market share since 2018 and now it has problems with liquidity and rising debt levels. More pain ahead for Under Armour.  I wouldn't touch it. $NKE obviously the better business.

This quarter, there was a 19% YoY drop in revenue for Adidas. Net income fell to about $34M (on approx. $5B of revenue).

Next quarter, if revenue drops 40% YoY as they expect, it’s highly likely Adidas will lose money. $NKE too probably.

So no new positions today..

In a gymless age, free-trial fitness apps are exploding off the bench, thanks to “quarantine” codes and discounts. But it’s not just big players like Nike and Peloton; small, boutique studios like Pilates-inspired BodyRok and Sky Ting yoga are joining in.

$MSFT w/a $1.3T mkt cap is trading at a PEG ratio of 3.15.
$AMZN w/a $1.16T mkt cap is trading at a forward P/E of 79.
$AAPL w/a $1.3T mkt cap is trading at a 24.2 forward P/E amid collapsing global consumer demand & manufacturing.

And that's the safety trade.

It's interesting as a bit of a sneakerhead to see how $NKE went from losing to $ADDYY with the Ultraboost/NMD, to now crushing it with Jordans and AF1's everywhere. Have to say $NKE quality is now far superior to $ADDYY as well; wasn't always the case.

I think shorting $NKE is a very bad idea. The company is a leader of digital transformation in consumer sector, they are investing a ton in their DTC via P&L. They are positioned to take market share. Health and wellness secular trend. Why would you want to be short?

$DIS and $AMZN worked great for my kids. $NFLX might be better for others. For kids into sports, $NKE works. If they make weekly pilgrimages to $HD w/dad, that might be best.

Lol exactly, that's my point :) On a relative basis I think it's very appealing. $LULU also if it can maintain rev growth and latest quarter of +20% net margin is sustainable. I'm just not in that camp. $NKE is a stalwart and already huge so much more limited upside imo.

That is highly unlikely. EPS growth will probably be closer to ~10% p.a. than ~20% p.a. over 20 years, and they are unlikely to benefit from significant expansion in the P/E as they did over the past 20 years (if my math is right, $NKE traded at ~20x earnings in June 2000).

I agree with your entire thread. It was a very smart deal by $LULU and their stock price is up 4% after hours thus adding $1.5B of market cap and paying for the deal already 

At some later date $PTON $NKE $AAPL and $AMZN will all regret not buying Mirror first.

Amazon is losing in every segment, in retail (offline to $WMT $COST $TJX $BBY and online to brands like $NKE) and in cloud to $MSFT

I was a $NKE shareholder back in the day. Sold in the mid $80s last year after it continued to trade between $80 and $87 while the greater market plowed forward.

But both are great long term investment (5+ Years). They don't really pay out a good dividend, but you will profit from the capital appreciation.

$SHAK, $NKE,$SBUX. lots of companies have senior convertible notes.  its pretty cheap to borrow money so that's all it is.  Technically almost free money for all the companies to just issue convertible.  I think its kinda stupid for any CFO not to take advantage of it.

$NKE should have been more aggressive with acquisitions the past decade. I’m surprised they have not really done anything to add meaningful revenue streams. It’s probably too late to buy $LULU now.

I think buying Mirror was a good acquisition for $LULU if they execute and cross sell. 

$NKE should have bought $LULU and $PTON over the past few years. That would have made them such a diversified powerhouse and brought new growth investors into the stock.

The challenge is, whether to go with, or find fault with, even that 1 page on mgmt / 1 sentence on valuation. 

Particularly, the p/e that the analyst is willing to ""assign"" to the stock. Recently an analyst gave a 33x fwd to $NKE. Subjective.

$NKE update per request:
-Daily inverted H&S gave us a successful push
-Inverted H&S MUST come test neckline as support to confirm the pattern
-Retested breakout and bounced
-If we hold above 105 don't see a reason we do not continue

Hope this helps

$NKE has a $166B market cap, they could easily buy $PTON for $25B in cash & stock.

$NKE could accelerate sales of $PTON through their stores, website, digital products and of course their athletes.

$NKE already has the most influential athletes as ambassadors of their products.

Yeah, owning $NKE or Adidas versus $FL is crazy. IDENTICAL DRIVERS of demand, and a pretty much fixed profit margin split in-between brands and stores. The man sees Tiger wearing Nikes though, and don’t understand why urban shoppers would line up for hours at Foot Locker to buy.

$NKE :). Haven't traded the name yet, but I'm always glad when the chart works out. 

Where the chart is basing leads me to believe we could get more of a run into earnings. Possibly as soon as this week. Next fib level is 132.

$NKE $111.50 - Stock is close to its 52 week right now. Had a nice run from low $60's in late March. If I own it, I would lock most of my gains and wait for a pull back. I wouldn't chase here but wait for a 20% - 30% dip to buy imo.

I don’t know enough about the $NLS team but I assure you i’ll never buy $NKE stock. I’d put $SBUX in that same category as untouchable for my portfolio. 

I’m not surprised to hear $NLS team blows considering the stock got down to $1.25/share. That doesn’t happen with good teams.

This is bullish for $LULU long term similar to $NKE did few months before when they stopped selling in Amazon and opened their DTC channel. This digital transformation create more engagement for LULU and add mirror acquisition to the mix. I will initiate some position on this

There seems to be a smaller competitor $NLS in this space as well. Would be interesting to watch if the big brands like $NKE would enter this space as well.

Most of them have a horrible track record this year so their analysis is a great contrarian indicator.

I agree. This is why $NKE or $LULU should buy $NLS tomorrow for $30/share. It’s a no brainer. Zero downside risk.

Do you think $NKE dips at all before it goes back up? Deciding whether to get in an option call when it opens or wait for a dip at on point during the week?

It’s very possible the valuation spread between $PTON and $NLS narrows over the next year which means $NLS has some catching up to do. 

Personally I think $NKE would be insane not to buy $NLS and build out a legit competitor to $PTON.

In 2017 I bought a 2014 Accord for $13k certified preowned 0 down at 0.9% financing for 4 years ~$200 interest over the loan

Also in 2017 bought $23k worth of $NKE stock at $51 per share

$NKE is now $127.91 per share

Fortunately I can draw the line wherever I like . I go on my gut - $FB for me is complicit in rise of teenage suicide. $PLTR helps ICE deport migrants. All stuff that doesn’t pass my gut check so I’m out. $NKE running sweatshops I don’t like, but I don’t gag as hard

Oh and $NKE has had a nice run. It's not a growth company so I'd be trimming that position down right about now. 76x earnings is not sustainable for their business.

1) Following a dominant career at UNC and an Olympic gold medal, Michael Jordan had a decision to make.

Which shoe brand would he sign with?

Despite wearing Converse in college and during the Olympics, Jordan says ""I wanted Adidas.""

The only problem?

Adidas didn't want him.

Hear you AK but where to draw the line? Despise $NKE because of their manuf practises yet they r ok paying Ronaldo 83M. The most egregious and hypocritical so I avoid but I'm sure all shoe manuf r the same? Do I now broaden the scope to anybody with questionable labor practices

In 2-3 years $AAPL might buy $PTON. They are similar. Have great hardware with a big focus on design, where they make money. That leads to subscription business. They are closer to each other. Else $NKE buys them before Dec 2021

$GAXY -- 4h chart (1stpic). I like it here because it it creating a reversal monentum to squeeze into .01+ range .. (it needs to trade .0095+ for this to happen)

2nd chart- (Daily) -- 20SMA sits at .011 

Two areas to focus .0095-.011+ for breakout.

at this valuation and without clear post covid picture $NKE might not buy $PTON but without waiting for Covid it may buy smaller companies like $NLS or others.

We all remember Apple Music and $SPOT. If home workout is permanent thing, $PTON will be the leader. I am expecting $NKE jump into this. $40 per month is very lucrative business and have existing partnerships with lot of sports people which can be leveraged to attract fans.

I’m long $pton (not super passionately), but I don’t really understand the moat argument. Some industries don’t have Bonafide moats in the sense of IP. Sometimes the brand is the moat. are bearish on $lulu $nke $cmg too... because they don’t have bulletproof moats either.

$NKE just seeing this stock after a very long time. Guess it did hit upper area. Didnt track this at all. Now 135. Looks like can do 197 target. Above 133 bullish . Above 145 has 169/83/197. below 121 weak. #fitness #shoes

I feel your pain. Can’t believe $DKNG is dropping like this. They are out there signing exclusive deals like they are $NKE.

$PENN & $DKNG are going to be the top leaders in the sports gambling sector as more states hop on the bandwagon and legalize it.

$AAPL shows 105 although OI shows around 115-120. Not convinced as the chart is constructive. $MSFT normally a good pinning play like $NKE $JPM is at 212.50. Nice iron condor sale would work surrounding this price.

Thanks, I loosely follow the company. Yesterday I have read a report from one broker having target price @ 75x FY21 EPS, assuming ~36% EPS growth vs FY19. $NKE is valued at almost 50x fwd EPS, growing mid single digits. I am aware of the moats, but these things seem rich.

$NKE Options Idea

Nike hit 52 week high 140.52, look for this to test that heading in to final week before Christmas. $UA follows along as well. Record spending this year during Black Friday. You can add this all up for a bullish run in to Earnings. Safe Call 01/15 $150c.

I dont hate $PTON at all. I think it has the optionality (apparel, etc.) to be a great stock. $NKE is ~$38B in sales and $200B in MCap. $PTON is $40B Mcap and $2B in sales. It will have to get there with fitness and wellness - e.g. bikes, treadmills, apparel, subscriptions.

With the Precor acquisition, $PTON also acquires a significant number of patents.  These could add to to their portfolio of equipment:
- elliptical machine

- gym control units

New- $PTON $TSLA $LULU 
Old (but strong)- $AAPL $DIS $NKE

For better or for worse, when I think of strong brands, I think of the following:

1) Status symbols  
2) Cult-like following & fanboys 
3) Price inelastic (premium)

They earn these through design and top customer sat.
