Sit down, Gareth. Your lot aren’t exactly perfect. What allegedly happened last night is a disgrace but don’t take the moral high ground when fans of the very club you support have been found guilty of this in the past  http://dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1123823/Four-Tottenham-fans-banned-indecent-Campbell-chants.html…

I did hear that the fan used the word ‘Yid’ in a phrase (as he used to play for Tottenham) This could have been misinterpreted. But if not the the so called fan should never step foot inside any football stadium again.

Yeah that was it with #CyrilleRegis . We all wanted to be hom no matter of our ethnic background. And in times of racial tension he simply transcended race. The man was simply loved by all and a true legend. God bless him. #RIPCyrilleRegis

Best thing the club could do for Cyrille, is to take over the funding of the 3 degrees statue and put it outside the East Stand alongside the Tony Brown one. It’s been a farce how long this is supposed to have taken. DO IT NOW!!!

76 points is woeful for a player who's played every single game. He is 19% selected cos 1. he is incredibly cheap and plays 90 mins each week & 2. He scored in gameweek 1, 1 million people instantly brought him in, and then never signed in to FPL again @nickhgale. Terrible post

Wow! Unnecessary. 
Remembering Cyrille is not disrespecting anyone.
It’s the 60th birthday of our much loved and respected friend
We still mourn him.
We as a club and its fans will continue to celebrate 
the life of the Cyrille Regis
Try not to be offended on anyone else’s behalf

Tony Mowbray needs to be involved for me. Cleared out deadwood last time he was there and imposed a football philosophy. Director of football at least. U23s have had a shocking season, cupboard is pretty bare.

. We innovated the idea/concept 4 years ago and now have 12 clubs/stadiums done. At least 8 more in the process. We have written to all clubs throughout the leagues, so progress is being made.

Good shout. Won't hurt to blood them. But pressure of any feignt chance of staying up will mean they don't play. Easier to throw in attacking players where mistakes won't be highlighted as much.

As CEO I hope we look at the demise of the club over the past 2 years and learn what we have done wrong. Things have not been the same since the likes of Dan Ashworth left the club, as a positive move forward we should approach Dan and get him back to our club before others do.

Good Evening @WBA I would like to put my name foward for an early contender for the managers post that will becoming available before the end of the season, it will. I would be just as comfortable in the Premiership or Championship.

Big Dave is a top bloke and will have our backing regardless of results. Fans and Big Dave were never the problem though: New owner is to blame, Hammond is to blame, Williams was to blame, Pulis was to blame and Pards was to blame. 20 years of progress undone in 12 months: #wba

Dean Smith.
 Mcinnes struggled at Bristol. Appleton has not managed at a high level well. Potter has not been outside Sweden. 
Must be Smith - young, local, knows the league, knows players and plays attacking football.
Must move beyond nostalgia of ex- players for the job.

5500 Leeds fans at Fulham last week & like they do every visit to us, every single one stood the entire game, infact most visiting fans stand. Safe standing has to come in, empty seats in the premier league an indication of how sterile the match experience has become.

Good to see West Brom ""have responded to feedback from fans by extending the under-17 category, including the £99 season ticket, to under-18"". Important for atmosphere, and for the future. Of course, #WBA have to woo fans after relegation but this move deserves acknowledging. https://twitter.com/WBA/status/994525297184788480…

Fair play to Darren Moore, he's been excellent and seems like a great a bloke. West Brom should do everything they can to keep him there. But knowing football they will proably end up with another (safe) dinosaur, hopefully there will be one up for grabs on Monday morning...

Why on earth would he want to manage the club he loves, continue his amazing record, bring #WBA back up from the Championship, cement his legacy as a legend, stay in his home town, and get paid well for it?

As a club know for breaking racial boundaries in the late 70's early 80's with the likes of big Cyril etc, I would like to think colour would never be on the agenda when hiring a manager. Like almost every other baggies fan I   would love to see DM as our manager full time.

That’s a real shame about Evans, in hindsight you wish Albion had just cashed in on him previously. Yacob has been so underused, I’d like him to stay but if he’s had enough at Albion too then bye bye. Get this squad refreshed

As a #dcfc I am delighted that such a lovely, genuine and kind man has got his opportunity in the game. He embodies what people- not only footballers should be like. Totally humble and hardworking. Legend at our club and hope he does well. Look forward to welcoming him to PP.

English premier league is all about money it’s more of a business than football. With those money they control the media and trying to show the world they are the best but in reality even German & Italian league is better than the premier league when it comes to football

Will be like when Wolves appointed Terry Connor. I really hope Moore succeeds but WBA have made classic mistake of comparing his results to the previous manager’s rather than thinking what/who they need to get promoted. Many better options out there.

Brilliant to see Darren Moore appointed by @WBA. Always known as a good coach. Proved he has what it takes to be a good manager when given chance as caretaker. Clearly, some tough times lie ahead sorting the squad and in the Championship but he's as tough as they come. 1/2

Same. Many might have a dislike of villa but that's as far as it goes. The games against wolves are far more tense, far more police protected like 12pm KO's etc. We play villa at 3 most of the time. Even TV don't pick it any more

But being realistic, they're far bigger than us so we'd do the same if boot was on the other foot. We had the whole money money money thing with wolves in the 90's. We had none, they had shed loads and they loved to tell us. Then 2002 happened!

The last time I met him was quite by accident. I had ""popped"" into town to the shops. There was a crowd between the Kings and Queens Squares. There was Jeff, opening  a burger bar. I didn't have a pen with me but Lorraine kindly tore some paper from his diary. Wonderful couple.

Injury jinxed.
We got him fit and flogged him.
Now he's too slow for the Championship, in my view he'd be a waste of money.... same scenario as when Pallister came back.
He'd hardly play and cost us a fortune for the privilege.

Terry never had pace and is 3 years older than Huth, Villa played deep so as not to expose Terry.
Huth wouldn't get that protection at Boro & at 10 years older than Gibbo he's hardly a decent replacement.
In 3 years Huth played  only 53 games at Boro, we were lucky to sell him!

Not sure about this. Huth and his family aee settled in Cheshire so a move to Stoke or Derby would make more sense for him. I'd be more than happy with him tho.

That transfer cost you a trip to Barbados with All Stars. You withdrew on Friday as we flew Saturday. Ally Rob Benno Gary Owen Ally Brown went you should have been 5th. Bajans wanted us to have a black player and Gilesy agreed you could go. Benno brother went instead! Brill trip.

I went to that game after work in my suit and sat with a Millwall pal. I remember you and Cyrille with hands on hips after they scored and their fans running on the pitch close by. Handy to have a London accent at the time. Enjoyed the replay.

Rooney off from Everton to DC United. Only there a year but have never thought his season was the level of disappointment a lot are keen to make out. Top scorer & contributed to most of a poor season's best moments - classic 60-yard to complete a hat-trick v West Ham for one.

Rafa Benitez’s contract talks at a standstill. He suggested - as he has for months - that he’ll wait to see if his squad has enough to compete this season before signing a new deal. So can’t see this being resolved quickly...

Even as a squad player. He is just one of those players that belongs at the club. I wouldn't take him back in the Prem but at Championship level I think he would do a good job for us. Especially now Yacob has gone. And I'd rather him over Reo-Coker.

Are you serious? In Rondon, Rodriguez, Chadli, Dawson and possibly Hegazi, there’s a potential of at least £70 million of which some is inevitably going to be spent on new players. Very little can be done if they don’t move on. Pull yourselves together #wba #weredoomed

Been told that the Ryan Woods to Swansea deal is ‘definitely off’. Player ready to travel and do medical, but Swansea not willing to pay the £6.5m fee. And, yes, Clucas is set to sign for Stoke. Feeling within Swansea is that it’s been a disastrous day (not my word).

First game I’ve got to in a while today, as a Baggies fan living in Norwich. Its also my birthday so it made it a great day-we were so poor first half it was untrue, and were lucky to win today as it could have gone very differently. Nyom is shocking & need more mobility in MF.

Quite - he's ready for more ""bits & pieces"" but not to take a full load of responsibility & pressure as a regular starter in midfield! A special talent that needs bringing on sensibly! Too much yet could spoil him!

The signing of Jones as Moore's No 2, is vital... Shades of Belgium in the World Cup with that shape and intent..
Hugely promising, and I imagine, great fun to play in....

Used to buy Sports Argus now and again on way home through Midlands after watching Superwhites down south. We had The Buff or Pink Final to choose from within the hour after Saturday games. What a shame both have gone now. Happy days.

Very good defensive midfielder, strong in the tackle and will probably be about the most aggressive player in the league. Think he’s exactly what we need, there doesn’t seem to be any steel in our midfield and I think he will solve that

FLASHBACK: Sheff Utd vs West Brom, 2002. Includes one of the worst tackles in football history, and some excellent foreshadowing in the commentary box.

""Georges Santos has had a bit of history with Andy Johnson. That first challenge will be interesting...""

When purchasing tickets online you need to ensure you log in with your season ticket number and password. Many supporters have numerous accounts and log into the wrong account so the system can’t recognise that you are a season ticket holder.

Hillsborough was exposed because the British Establishment had a fall guy in Duckenfield. In the case of the Birmingham Pub Bombings, the fall guys are the British Establishment. If the truth emerges it will potentially bring down governments both side of Irish Sea

Gareth Barry offered a modicum of passing skills and greater intent when he came on and frankly, lifted the team..
To play a three at the back, your central defender has to be comfortable on the ball, organize, and pass....
Heghazi is a solid centre back, but not in this role..

Shocking... but not surprising..
To play a Back three, you sacrifice a defender to create an overload in an attacking position.. The combination of slow possession and poor passing allows teams to regroup, thus losing any momentum..
Teams have worked us out, need to adapt, Quick.

Lucky enough to watch a preview of this documentary. Caught the first 15 mins and was genuinely blown away. 

This clip stood out. There’s a beautiful line at the end of the WBA game to look out for, too.

Any intolerance chants or behaviour are not typical of the Albion physique. Everyone is welcome. The club's ability to reach out to different communities is fantastic. I just wish it works harder to foster Albion support outside the British shores too, especially in Europe.

We also had them come up to an 8 year old girl on the back row who was standing on her seat because she couldn’t see as everyone in front was standing up. Yet the steward in question simply threatened her to get off the seat. How about asking the adults to sit down? Discrace tbh

I saw Ridgy a few times.. 
Always solid, 
Moved out to left back in a Pulis back four of 6 footers, seemed best at home in central defence.. 
Never gave less than 100%, 
Portland was a great move for him, 
Hope they win tonight, but will be hard....
Atlanta's fluidity is enticing

Plenty of running, good movement, likes to try and get in behind. More suited to playing with a bigger partner, because he's not the most physical, but still managed to find the net when he had to play up on his own for most of the first part of this season. Be a big loss for us.

Love your loyalty. Sometimes though we have to make a stand and just say no else clubs will take the piss out of us. I was prepared to miss one game if it made a point but luckily it’s been rectified to an extent before. Fan power is a wonderful thing

No problem mate. Text sometimes comes across differently. 
All we wanted was a reasonable price for fans that many will take time off work to support the club. I feel we now have that.

He was a great player though. The is a video of him going past so many players so quickly that his team mates couldn't get up into the box so he just sat on the ball and waited :-)
