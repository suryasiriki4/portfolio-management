I did hear that the fan used the word ‚ÄòYid‚Äô in a phrase (as he used to play for Tottenham) This could have been misinterpreted. But if not the the so called fan should never step foot inside any football stadium again.

I could see you were visibly upset but it was a total accident. I thought you were incredible throughout. I am sure WBA will be fine with you as their striker. Best player on the pitch by some distance.

You have changed us from a team who could defend and attack set plays to a team that look like conceding from every set piece, some of the defending is laughable an U 11s team would be ashamed of it. Pulis killed our club Pardews destroyed it. #wba #pardewout

Dean Smith.
 Mcinnes struggled at Bristol. Appleton has not managed at a high level well. Potter has not been outside Sweden. 
Must be Smith - young, local, knows the league, knows players and plays attacking football.
Must move beyond nostalgia of ex- players for the job.

5500 Leeds fans at Fulham last week & like they do every visit to us, every single one stood the entire game, infact most visiting fans stand. Safe standing has to come in, empty seats in the premier league an indication of how sterile the match experience has become.

Fair play to Darren Moore, he's been excellent and seems like a great a bloke. West Brom should do everything they can to keep him there. But knowing football they will proably end up with another (safe) dinosaur, hopefully there will be one up for grabs on Monday morning...

Why on earth would he want to manage the club he loves, continue his amazing record, bring #WBA back up from the Championship, cement his legacy as a legend, stay in his home town, and get paid well for it?

As a club know for breaking racial boundaries in the late 70's early 80's with the likes of big Cyril etc, I would like to think colour would never be on the agenda when hiring a manager. Like almost every other baggies fan I   would love to see DM as our manager full time.

Brilliant to see Darren Moore appointed by @WBA. Always known as a good coach. Proved he has what it takes to be a good manager when given chance as caretaker. Clearly, some tough times lie ahead sorting the squad and in the Championship but he's as tough as they come. 1/2

Jimmy Sanders, his predecessor as Albion's keeper, stepped in and got the winner's medal, featuring in that famous photo as Ronnie Allen took the penalty at the other end.  Sanders had guested for @ErithBelvedere during the war which is how come I know the story!

Swansea at home in the 2nd leg semi, and the final are two days that I will never forget. Atmosphere in both games were just incredible - remember joining the queue for Wembley tickets about 3.00am on a Sunday morning outside the old Rainbow stand.

Same. Many might have a dislike of villa but that's as far as it goes. The games against wolves are far more tense, far more police protected like 12pm KO's etc. We play villa at 3 most of the time. Even TV don't pick it any more

But being realistic, they're far bigger than us so we'd do the same if boot was on the other foot. We had the whole money money money thing with wolves in the 90's. We had none, they had shed loads and they loved to tell us. Then 2002 happened!

Injury jinxed.
We got him fit and flogged him.
Now he's too slow for the Championship, in my view he'd be a waste of money.... same scenario as when Pallister came back.
He'd hardly play and cost us a fortune for the privilege.

Terry never had pace and is 3 years older than Huth, Villa played deep so as not to expose Terry.
Huth wouldn't get that protection at Boro & at 10 years older than Gibbo he's hardly a decent replacement.
In 3 years Huth played  only 53 games at Boro, we were lucky to sell him!

I thought

 looked a real prospect when he was with FGR. A lot of important tackles, clearances and headers. That first goal as well mind. As well as the ability he seemed like he had a good composure and mentality. Definitely one to watch.

The signing of Jones as Moore's No 2, is vital... Shades of Belgium in the World Cup with that shape and intent..

Gareth Barry offered a modicum of passing skills and greater intent when he came on and frankly, lifted the team..
To play a three at the back, your central defender has to be comfortable on the ball, organize, and pass....
Heghazi is a solid centre back, but not in this role..

I have to admit the best away support at the Hawthorns this season- proper set of ‚Äòreal‚Äô fans,  and too be honest you sometimes can‚Äôt beat a bit of ‚Äòole school‚Äô abrasiveness you don‚Äôt get in the premiership - plus ‚Äòno one likes them‚Äô Good on you Millwall & thanks for the 3 points

Why is Brunt back in the side?
Barry by far a better player in the position.
Houllahan would be a better option if Barry needs resting.
Would even Field could do a better job.

I'm a Baggies fan, and it's good to see this. But it would also be good to include on videos like these some sort of link/info that people currently suffering from mental health issues can follow. Have Albion got a number/page on their website for fans with depression/anxiety?

When you here Big Dave speak, you know its from the heart and not just the usual lip service supporters are often offered. Very proud he is our manager and although I was initially fearful that his appointment could have backfired, I am chuffed to bits with how he is managing us

It was a privilege to be part of todays celebrations.

Well done to everyone involved for creating an inspiring and iconic statue in the heart of our community, celebrating the lives of the Lions of The Great War and honouring the sacrifices they made for us all

Shocking... but not surprising..
To play a Back three, you sacrifice a defender to create an overload in an attacking position.. The combination of slow possession and poor passing allows teams to regroup, thus losing any momentum..
Teams have worked us out, need to adapt, Quick.

Lucky enough to watch a preview of this documentary. Caught the first 15 mins and was genuinely blown away. 

This clip stood out. There‚Äôs a beautiful line at the end of the WBA game to look out for, too. 

Hope it‚Äôs also put on @itv main channel very soon  twitter.com/itvfootball/st‚Ä¶

I saw Ridgy a few times.. 
Always solid, 
Moved out to left back in a Pulis back four of 6 footers, seemed best at home in central defence.. 
Never gave less than 100%, 
Portland was a great move for him, 
Hope they win tonight, but will be hard....
Atlanta's fluidity is enticing

Plenty of running, good movement, likes to try and get in behind. More suited to playing with a bigger partner, because he's not the most physical, but still managed to find the net when he had to play up on his own for most of the first part of this season. Be a big loss for us.
