Bump this. I like the technical setup here. The other three charts are nice. $AAPL and $MSFT both lovely trending up. $GOOGL too just a little more choppy. $AMZN above the recent highs around 1825. Last candle kept the low above the 200 SMA only 4* from Morningstar must be winner

Top 10 open source projects (GitHub’s Octoverse):

3 from Microsoft
3 from Google
0 from Amazon

Amazon strip mines great open source projects to drive AWS revenue well, but has released 0 meaningful open source projects while running the largest cloud since 2006.

Disappointing.

2) $GOOGL (long)
3) $MSFT (long)
4) $AAPL (no position)

$AAPL buys nothing big (ever, thus far).

$FB Could work, but regulators would squash it.

What is the magnitude of that error? With $msft maybe 20% max. With $xom, 50 to 100%.

2 additional points: 

1) $MSFT has stated the obvious reason the new consoles allow physical discs... people want them.

2) The coronavirus-driven stampede to GameStop is undeniable proof there remains substantial demand in 2020 for the physical gaming equipment $GME sells.

There was a time when Bill Gates might have been hated more than Zuck is today and Microsoft was routinely called the ""evil empire.""

1.- Windows and Office are the stickiest software that you can find.

3.- Widening the moat , reinvesting ~40% FCF in the business

Is not the data used pretty tortured? Segmenting the S&P 500 between those who are not cash rich? If you look at the total S&P 500 coverage ratios are huge & growing (https://yardeni.com/pub/spxratios.pdf…). From this data, S&P 500 should take on more debt.

Options contract that $MSFT will hit $210 a year from now-ish. When I hit the date seen there, I’ll be able to buy 100 shares at $210 regardless of actual price. The goal is to sell before then, because the contract will be more (hopefully) valuable. Also 4/20. Lol.

I don't love any FAANGs or $MSFT now, but the different angle today vs past bubbles is that the relative EPS this time are booming, whereas the past bubbles that wasn't so much the case.

$AMZN $MSFT $GOOG could buy $FSLY for $15B in cash and it would barely put a dent in their war chest or buy with stock and would barely impact earnings. But it would require at least $145/share to get it done.

if $MSFT holds above 197, the next short-term targets are 220 and then 229

Microsoft will offer a new service called Azure Orbital, as the company looks to compete with Amazon's AWS Ground Station in connecting satellites directly to data centers.

$MSFT beat the market over the last 20 years, even from the WORST valuation possible. And that's assuming you just bought once!

Point of the tweet isn't that valuation shouldn't be considered. It should.

1) Level recaptures (""fake breakdowns""). Any level that is lost and then reclaimed- shown below.

2) Trendline breakouts or breakdowns. Break out of a clean well drawn line

3) Entering in the middle of a tightly coiled flag/triangle pattern

Price correlations are random. Is you try $MSFT instead of TIPS you will get R^2 = 0.9. Returns correlations are better but also have high randomness. In general, correlations are dynamic and can change any time. In fact, TIPS/GLD correlation plunged after crash in March.

Big if.  I wouldn't say it's $MSFT.  More finite revenue streams with higher susex.  But similar multiple.  Cash cow.  Low PE.  Long record of growth.  Just wondered it the pharma analysts see key risk of reversal of fortune.  Insider selling lately.

Always risk involved, but when major support held across the board (on an overly exaggerated move), it was time to buy. All my chart targets are currently in progress: $AAPL to $121, $AMZN to $3300 (at least!), $AMD to $91, $MSFT to $220, $FB to $273, $TSLA to? (way up there?).

I don’t think $ZM ever gets to $1 trillion. No way. The market will never be big enough and there will be more competitors. $ZM will never have the moats that $AAPL $MSFT $AMZN and $GOOG have. 

I’d be shocked if $ZM ever gets to $500B.

My God the rooms are identical, how did I not notice? $MSFT clearly signalling an interest in $INS here, replacing the Dr Pepper with a plant pot was enough to misdirect me but you've seen right through it. No wonder it was up 20% pre-market yesterday.

Anything over $24B for $WORK is overpaying. $30B would be irresponsible by $CRM. 

$WORK was a $14B a couple weeks ago and facing very tough competition from $MSFT. 

Paying a 50-60% premium to that price should be more than enough.

We hit our stop scenario of close below 3150 on this trade with today's market sell=off.

I am still in this trade and did not act on the stop due to broader market sell off

 That 3150 is the strong level, Bears cannot close it below that.

Setup is bullish with 3450 PT as long as we are above the 3150 level i gave originally.

Fun looking back on old internal value investment memos.

The mainstream financial media is in love w/ $MSFT today at a $1.4T mkt cap, or 30x EBIT of ~$50B, however I had courage to buy when everyone hated it at <8x EBIT of ~$28B in 2012.

They even had the old logo back then!

Here’s the beauty about ultrafast growers: these companies grow so fast that Wall Street can’t value them very accurately. This can leave a stock inefficiently priced, providing a big opportunity for superperformance. There's no appropriate PE for a stock growing at a huge rate.

$MSFT to ATH Count

$MSFT is currently in CHOP city, seeing an extended WXY correction on a lower degree, trading in a range

Should we hold above my invalidation level at 208.16, I think we could see ATH with a bullish range break

Looks good if we can break 220

I worked at $MSFT and $AMZN so they are both about 10% - 12% each (5+ year holds), but for 

25% of my net worth and still sleep (new) I would put it in $NVDA it is going to be the growth monster of the decade

With rates low, the market a a whole probably deserves 18-19x. $AAPL probably deserves some premium to that, maybe up to 25x, not higher I don't think. 

By 2025, $AAPL will have generated ~$400bn in cash, so that + 25x $90-100bn is $2.25-$2.5 trillion = ~4-6% IRR's. 5/6
