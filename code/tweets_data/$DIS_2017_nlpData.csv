At best Disney has made $1.8 Billion thus far. 

Studios keep about 55-60%of US box office. Could be more for Star Wars. International is normally a lower %

The revenue from their Film segment isn't enough to propel the company/stock yet. Media segment (espn, Dis channel, etc) is number 1 with roughly 40% of revenue and Studio Entertainment (Star Wars, finding Dory, etc)  is no where near that - their 3 largest rev segment. $DIS
