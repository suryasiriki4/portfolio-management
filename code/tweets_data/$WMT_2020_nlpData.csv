Bought a 40"" Hisense/$Roku at $wmt for $179 for basement workout room. Far cheaper than any other model at that size/spec. Been hooking up other apps like Vudu/movies anywhere, prime, Netflix. Until one uses it, one can't see the big picture. Remote is slick & uses WiFi.

The natural buyer for $ROKU is $WMT or $MSFT. 

Zero chance of AMZN. Would be immediately shut down by regulators. 

$AAPL buys nothing big (ever, thus far).

$FB Could work, but regulators would squash it.

a probably 175% () of all the *crap* they sell in $WMT  is made in China---of the few items not from China, the quality is still inferior when compared to that same item sold in another store. I think companies send their inferior products to Walmart, to get rid of them.

Global supply chain is getting disrupted due to #coronavirus issue.

These are the companies heavily dependent on/linked to China. Combined revenue would exceed a few hundred billion:

This time around, I went with:

$COST > $HD > $WMT > $TGT

Target has the most to lose from online shopping. WalMart is upping its e-commerce presence, but overall growth is still flat. 

Home Depot has less competition, and Costco has the best membership-based business model.

No. Because Walmart & Dollar General serve a demographic that won‚Äôt likely sign up for Prime or have same day delivery options with Prime. 

At same time, $WMT is no threat to Amazon either. They will both continue to do their thing.

Amazon's top line was as big as they wanted it to be. The valuation won't make any more (or less) sense no matter what they say.

The obvious move is selling ahead of the number. Then you end up with cash to put to work, probably in $AMZN eventually.

I agree.  For me, $AMZN either didn't have stuff in stock, or was not offering 2 day prime delivery (which I am charged an annual sub).  However, $WMT had many items in stock, and offered 2 day delivery with $35 orders.

$WMT sends packages as well & regularly witnessed much cheaper. So I don't get delivery in 24hrs but $AMZN works their warehouse workers to the bone to achieve 24hr delivery. There's a trade-off that I'm comfortable with & have bought from $AMZN less than 10 times this year...

$AMZN $WMT etc oplev eroding over time, accessing the producer surplus theyve built up thru subsidies (shipping prime etc). could have absolute pricing power across the board. Potentially also firm bk in factor markets create supply inbalance.

Fun facts: 

* Target has 4-5% of the US grocery market already. 

* That makes $TGT roughly 2x the size of $AMZN in groceries. 

* $AMZN has been growing WFM at 1%. Target will grow grocery somewhere over 4% on Wednesday.

So I think it'll probably work.  twitter.com/Radio_Shorts/s‚Ä¶

Live in $WMT home office land. Traffic was noticeably up this past weekend. Lots of folks at $HD and $LOW. Overall orderly. I imagine more hesitancy in play in restaurants, even w/ limited tables, small venues, etc. With more space, comes more comfort.

We are finding more $ spent on each grocery and $WMT trip.  While certainly some of that is replacing dine out and take out, seeing a lack of ""sale pricing"" that has bumped numerous unit costs up as well.  Probably a sign they are somewhat successful in passing on increased Opex.

Every investor is different. It may be ideal for you based on how you invest but not for me based on how I invest. 

I think the last boxes standing are going to be $WMT , $COST and $TGT. All great choices with the right horizon and perspective.

Names like nifty 50 and FANG/FAANG or whatever are always for the weak. You should own the best stocks, not some made-up name.

 $WMT was part of the N50 and returned 30% on average over 30 years. That's enough to turn $10,000 into $26M.

$WMT sells groceries. Any housewife can to it from her garage.

This is a crazy theory that a few friends of mine hold! They also will not shop at Sam's/Walmart bc many products are made in China. IMO get the best VALUE possible, China or not. Once $WMT stock fell to something I could buy, I took advantage! That's a BULL for me and up 14% !

Agree the shift has accelerated. Retailers with strong e-commerce platforms, BOPIS/BORIS, etc. should fare better. So many apparel/mall retailers are behind the curve though; e-commerce growth has been led by $AMZN $WMT $TGT etc.

Yep. I'm trying to give the most optimistic scenario. 

I personally think that the massive hiring by companies like $KR and $WMT is transient as (some) restaurants reopen, etc. Low wage jobs, anyway. 

50% is my guess, leaving UR at maybe 17-19%.

Yeah, it's a pretty lazy piece. And it's never a good idea to compare revenue of brand new start-up to long time incumbents. Imagine writing a story about how $AMZN only had $16 million in revenue in 1996 while $BNED had $2 billion and $WMT had $100 billion. You'd look dumb today

On the fundamental end, a lot of people have discovered during this pandemic that $AMZN is not the only retailer that will deliver quickly and cheaply. $TGT, $WMT, $OSTK and $W can often get it there quicker and cheaper. $AMZN will lose some market share, IMO.

$TSLA Employees blew the whistle on fraud, safety , harassment, sexual assault & more. Most disturbing, many were terminated immediately after contacting Musk or ethics hotline.

$TGT Looks really strong. If it holds over 125.52 it can run to 128, 130 quick. 

$WMT needs time. Not bad for common over 125 but would wait for 133 for calls imo. 

$NVTA needs to hold 28. Over 32 can get going to 35. Don't see a great trade yet.

Sales volume may scale wildly, but no pricing power=flows to consumer surplus.

Instead of looking at price per share, I‚Äôd look more at the dividend yield. For example, $T has around a 7% yield. $WMT has around a 1.66% yield.

So you are essentially getting more ‚Äúreturn‚Äù on your smaller investment on $T than $WMT

But that isn‚Äôt the only metric to look at!

Well, no, but did $WMT / $TGT spot change? Only distribution changed. You still get the same stuff from them, you differently. They haven‚Äôt backward integrated or anything (eg they don‚Äôt grow their own groceries, make their own laptops etc). The chain seems the same to me.

$BBY in addition to $TGT and $WMT. $HD too. $ADS as well as $NKE with DTC. Also The North Face and Vans at $VFC have done a great job. Also $SHOO I‚Äôm going wholesale to retail.

Best examples of tragic moves from wholesale to retail would include $COH and $RL.

60% is a monster gain for Prime Day sales. 

Notes: it helps to move Prime Day closer to Christmas. Also I bet $TGT and $WMT both had bigger increases in sales. 

Which shouldn‚Äôt minimize how impressive it is that $AMZN invented a new, unanimously beloved holiday.

My newest stock pick is Smith & Wesson $SWBI. 

This election is looking like a Democrat blowout which will send gun sales through the roof.

S&W‚Äôs financials are strong, with an excellent current valuation. The stock also pays a 1.22% dividend. 

STRONG BUY!

Fatter margins, faster growth, more modest valuation vs $BYND

products made of real, sustainably sourced, plant based food.

Love the brand, love Sarah G. Growing $WMT $COST $TGT distribution. 

DTC up & running.

In terms of ‚ÄúGARP‚Äù... hard to point to a more compelling name

 ¬∑ 10 Nov 2020
$TTCF vs. $BYND:

$TTCF 
a) 65% growth to $40M
b) Adjusted EBITDA 3.6% of revs

$BYND 
a) 39% retail growth, 2.7% total growth to $94M
b) Adjusted EBITDA -4.5% of revs

$BYND is more than 4x larger than $TTCF after all warrants considered.

You can guess which I prefer.
