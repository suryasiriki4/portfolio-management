Developing a new plane would cost around $20B.  Tweaking an existing one to improve, like old 737 to #737Max, would be $2B or less. This “patchwork development” of 737Max has costed Boeing >$30B so far.  A classic example of “cost cutting” gone wrong.

We're long $MAXR. Sequence of extraordinary events cut share price -80% in 2018. At $6.00 we see value & catalysts for a +200% rerating of share price. Wouldn't rule out M&A due to strategic nature of satellite business, highly sensitive defense contracts. One pager below; DYODD.

Posted this $BA chart on here earlier, now breaking through the trendline on the daily.

Not bad for a choppier $SPX day off the open! We caught calls off the break out. 

Now needs 325 to go. 328, 330 next levels if it can get through it.

The 200M $BA tossed them isn’t nothing, but it’s also not a lot. And it’s contingent on Max approval

EXACTLY.

Assets gravitate to stronger hands while employees have a degree of protection. It's not pretty but it's vital that it be done.

If $BA is a National Treasure, it does not follow that its equity, debt and/or current mgmt are.

At the heart of #Boeing is a fraud, aided by Wall Street analysts: that new plane designing is not expensive anymore. But the savings were really shortcuts, like the Max.

$BA stock rose from  $35 to $350. Assuming military biz is $100, a $135 stock at best. As I said in 2019.

Holy shit, Boeing spent *$43 billion* on stock buybacks, helping more than double its stock price in 2017-2018, enriching shareholders, only to meltdown from its mass produced faulty planes and the current coronavirus crisis. Now they need a bailout? https://nakedcapitalism.com/2020/03/boeing-crashes-43-billion-in-share-buybacks-turn-into-existential-threat.html…

When reporters talk about saving Boeing with a bailout, they should really talk about saving Boeing's incompetent management and the stock and bondholders who financed it. Boeing will be fine. Nothing will happen to Boeing. It will be better off with new management and less debt.

I still would like to know why we are bailing out corporations 5 weeks after all time highs. Corporations that have chosen to spend a cumulative $5.4 trillion in buybacks since 2009. That was their choice not to build any reserves.
People yes. Corporations after 5 weeks I don't.

With big drop in oil that's a COMPLETE game changer for $BA & selling point. 

Orders will be unfulfilled & the desire/need for fuel efficient air craft is no longer. 

So where does that leave $BA?

This is going to be long term fade regardless of bail out.

Oil = game changer. twitter.com/InvestorsLive/…

Ever heard of $BA? Boeing dropped 70% (bubble popped) and undid 7 years of earnings. A monkey could have seen that it was undervalued at $90. I made 87% and posted this setup for free.

Matt...I'd love to get your thoughts on Boeing (down 60%+ in last 12 month).  Has been hit by the perfect storm (some self-inflicted wounds) in the last year.   Some would argue ""too big and too strategic to fail"".   Under what time horizon does $BA become a buy?

Not a bad idea if the premiums are a lot lower than they were a month ago. I was looking at a $BA strangle but the IV is too high for my liking ATM. $XLF looks like the best strangle to do right now imo.

$BA a potential breakout or further breakdown may occur here. Might not be a bad idea for a strangle. If it falls below the $120 key level it can drop further.

With big drop in oil that's a COMPLETE game changer for $BA & selling point. 

Orders will be unfulfilled & the desire/need for fuel efficient air craft is no longer. 

So where does that leave $BA?

This is going to be long term fade regardless of bail out.

Oil = game changer. twitter.com/InvestorsLive/…

$BA consolidating between 130-137 since Monday. This needs to hold above 135 for continuation to 140, 145.

$GOOGL at 1410 breakout level. This has room to 1430. Downside it can test 1394, 1388.

$NFLX tested 445 resistance and it held. Above 450, this can run back up to 460.

Essentially 4 year lows for both companies. I’ve been thinking about buying some $BA to put away for the long term. 

If $BA can get back to those recent 52 week highs by 2025 then you’re looking at a minimum of 30% CAGR

$NVDA over 432 can run to 444, 458. 
$W if it holds over 267 it can run to 300, 317
$BA puts worked great under 172 so far. 154 is solid support lets see if it bounces. Otherwise, 140 next. 
$TTD looks good over 460 for a 475 test. Over 475 can see 500 fast.

$BA breaking down after HUGE miss on earnings... -2.92 ESTIMATE vs. -4.79 ACTUAL. 

though i don't think very many people had high expectations. or we would have seen a more violent price reaction than this. 

155.5 is the level to watch for potential support.

Let the others chase $DIS at $130 and $BA at $180 and $MAR at $97. No thanks. Those companies will face headwinds for the next 6-12 months or longer. I’m sticking with the stocks that are growing 50-100% with or without a pandemic.

if $BA is above 166, then the next swing trade target is 270

after 270, consolidation is due before another thrust to fill the gap at 334

$BA is a scalpers dream. That volatility is rare outside of Tesla theee days. Premiums are no joke but it’s tops on the watchlist.
That range it’s stuck in is fine by me.

Thank you! I been contemplating to go super long

1/21/22c - 200 strike 

Big bet. Risk is something I could stomach, but there are definitely other trades. I just don’t see $BA failing more by then. They are too big especially after a vaccine. Might jump if I see it fail tests

Same reason value managers are buying $WFC $CVX $BA $AAL etc — they assume things can’t get worse & all bad news is priced in.

Some fund managers have done well buying stocks when they’re hated and out of favor. I think it’s a dumb strategy.

I’ll stick w/ the disrupters.

Embrace for a very weak open, it will remain volatile but I am still predicting a GREEN close of DJIA.
Grab some solid fundamentally strong companies on fire sales prices, be selective with company & sector. 
Today will be great chance to buy some good stocks cheaply imo

$BA - Trade Idea - Oct 2 160C - bid/ask: 3.25/3.35

Closed at 156.03 on Friday. 

I would like to see a base form over 155. 

If BA can break above 161 it can test 165, 173, 180 next.

@squawksquare
.  If $BA tends to move the S&P around so much, it would stand to reason, adding $TSLA (like now) would be very positive.  I wonder if the S&P500 committee, is waiting for a ""crash"" and then add $TSLA, it would help the market recover quickly. no?

Want a contrarian investment idea? How about Boeing $BA?

This one's in pretty much the worst-case short-term scenario:

It had to ground its 737MAX last year, which led to a decline in its 2019 backlog. 

And on top of that, very few people are traveling at all right now.

Currently like $BA $GE (boomer plays) $PTON (xmas) $FSLY (40% off high) $PENN (sports, state rev) to nudge higher.
