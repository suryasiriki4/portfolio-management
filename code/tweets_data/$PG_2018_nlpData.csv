Here's the thing: if you have cash, now is a good time to buy some blue chips on sale. The ones you want to hold for years, like $BRK.B, or $DIS, or $PG, or $MMM, or even $UNH. But the real sale is yet to come in my opinion. It's always good to have at least 10-20% cash reserves.

Yeah, $EL falls under retail/discretionary to me (in the brick and mortar mall/fashion sense), which has been a very good sector to be in, but even $EL broke trend last week.  The larger weights in the group - $PG, $PEP, $CVS, $PM are where the larger concerns are though.

Yes, I see it. And $PG is likely to make an aggressive move upwards after a blowout quarter. I think this is prime buying time. Timing-wise, market has been stuck on Dow 2500 for awhile. It's due for an upstick to 2700 or so. Maybe 2800.
