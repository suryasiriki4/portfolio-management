I played $AAPL, $KIM, $WBA & stopped out of all 3. Played $NKE for the win. Red $14.12 for the day. The sad thing is I was green on every play & just wanted a little bit more & they turned red.  Not much green had I pulled the trigger & even less after my buy/sell fees. All good.

Crazy, right? Straight up. $DIS hot. Quite a move for $SEAS today, too. $UA had quite a run. $NKE near highs. $AAPL, too. Add $WWE and $HEAR... that's quite a portfolio I could've built if I solely focused on my kid!

My Dividend Growth Portfolio - 38 Holdings, 4 Buys, 3 Sells
I collected a $478 in dividends during July for a 49% year-over-year boost. I've pivoted my overall portfolio to have some more growth exposure given my long runway until retirement.

Apps are where the growth is. That should be the best customer experience (new customers, high margin, young demo... you need a good app). 

Also, your app experience *is* viable data. All app experiences should be the same. Download $M and $NKE‚Äôs apps. The problem is obvious.

Right. Which is unreal. A) How the hell do you release an app that horrible? Here's a Q for the next meeting: ""If customers can't use the Macy's app does that have a good or bad impact on our brand?""  B) If you're a brand like $NKE why do business in a dump like M?

Looking forward to next $NKE earnings report. My bet is the backlash against the backlash is going to very good for them. I went out and bought a pair of Nike‚Äôs just yesterday. I was a New Balance guy for years until found out co-founder gave $400k to Trump campaign.

$AMZN and $NKE are holding up discretionary and $AAPL and $NVDA are holding up tech. Small caps/momentum/beta all breaking down as growth slows. 3/4 of companies last quarter lowered guidance for Q4. Not good. When the generals get shot, this market is in for a world of hurt.
