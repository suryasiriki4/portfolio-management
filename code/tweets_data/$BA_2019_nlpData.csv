Boeing delivered 79 planes in Nov which means $BA has to ship 106 in Dec. simply to meet lower-end of FY guidance. They've NEVER delivered >91 in a month. Warned on this when the share price was closer to $380. Grounded.

Yeah and $ba pumped 20+% from December lows. Followed PA on Boeing pretty closely in 2018 but probably not gonna play any of these. I don’t like ever holding through earnings tbh unless playing 3-6 months out. Loaded $dis jun120s when it pulled back to 110 yesterday.

Here's the thing. I sold $BA calls at mid 4s. And it ran to 6+. If you are greedy then you resent it. If you love success then someone out there made 6 on it, and that is TERRIFIC. It was their risk. I made $$ and that person made $$, but never be envious. Could easy be a Loss.

There actually is such a thing as market feel: 80% of all stocks trend with the indexes and macro  news. This overpowers any single insight  you have on a single stock.  Fight the trend and you will lose.

Try changing your tickers to some more conservative less volatile ones like $msft $ba. I started trading with $168 and reached $380 this week day trading $msft and $nvda. Been booking $30, $50 gains quick. Not the best way to do it but it works for me. Also No OTMs. Mainly ATMs

$BA broke down 436-437 area and reaching 433ish. keep in mind 432 was key resistance for quite a while and then it turned into support level. so see if ba supported at 432 today. below that 429 427 but let's see if 432 supported first. twitter.com/option_snipper…

Great analysis Imran!  I'll add that $BA rested for 1 yr after a prior big move, w/c included a base reset. Inst. selling esp. in the last qtr (see decrease of funds). Something changed to its story that may have some funds coming back as evidenced by the move in the last 10 wks.

Gold has been suppressed for years. Been up nicely since Oct with CBs buying to bolster balance sheets. At the top of a bubble, safe assets are discarded. Ppl rather own $BA at 140 and get an ""automatic"" 1% daily return. It can only go up.

Keep in mind last time @southwest killed someone they squeezed the stock straight up for 2 days.

+ $BA is top weighting in $DJIA. That could be good enough excuse for degenarate PPT n their fanboys to be like ""more crashes=less regulation, less regulation is bullish for stock!""

Seems that the MCAS system could be responsible again. Very interesting that these incidents typically happen to airlines of developing countries and could be due to a training discrepancy as opposed to an actual flaw in the $BA 737 Max aircrafts.

They needed a 'healthy' correction anyway. No need to pump $djia right now the trade deal is not ready yet. $ba in all likelihood should go down. But maybe not as low as people would like. And certainly not indefinitively. The artificial pumping of Dow is not over!!

Strange how similar the facts we know so far parallel LionAir's flight. Climbed to 3000 aMSL, radioed ATC for permission to return BUT DIDN'T DECLARE AN EMERGENCY. Aircraft did not turn pre loss of control, steep dive.
AoA sensor reading 20deg higher for LHS speed.

Would only matter if $BA had to pay the airlines for their lost revenue and associated expenses during the grounding. Otherwise, it’s business as usual for them & the FAA. DOD’s pretty much made up for $BA’s lost revenues from delayed/cancelled orders w new contracts.

even though this is true, ask yourself why $BA doesn't operate a commercial airline carrier.  

because they're two completely different businesses with different models.  one produces goods, the other offers services.    the economics between the two are polar opposite.

$TSLA plan this weekend/monday was to load up on puts below 293, but premiums were way too expensive so avoided it. Short term target (this week) is 250 so if that hits i'll be pretty upset. Remember $TSLA fades are some of the best in option land, right along side $NFLX

At 00:14 US drone took off from UAE in stealth mode & violated Iranian airspace. It was targeted at 04:05 at the coordinates (25°59'43""N 57°02'25""E) near Kouh-e Mobarak.

We've retrieved sections of the US military drone in OUR territorial waters where it was shot down.

I suppose first, although semi's moved up on news as a whole, this was not a news gapper.  Today we had $BA, $FDX, and $WDC which all worked.  When in doubt check mult time frames. $AMD inside 30 worked.  For options, use 2nd candle as reference. .38 entry, .24 stop, went to .57.

Not even necessarily specific to $BA, but possibly to the industry as a whole. Guessing there probably isn't anything too major, like the 737 Max issues, but the amount of ""credit given"" for geometric similarity & any associated procedures/protocols are likely to change in future

This all comes down to regulatory capture IMHO, which is a hard variable to judge. I wouldn't be surprised if FAA allows return, but EU or China do not. In which case, $BA loses major market share to Airbus.

$SQ and $DIS are expensive.  

My buy point for $DIS is $122.  

$SQ just watching.

I agree with you on $BA and $AAPL.  I like $BA but thinking of taking profits and buying it lower.

I like $AAPL below $200.

$SQ I got impatient w/ but it's going to spike up to $75 i think

$DIS is at an ATH but priced right w/ market cap of $236B

$AAPL unless they come out w/ game changing product - they'll be where they are

Boeing 737 MAX refund scenario estimate of $100-150B is far off from reality. If Boeing were to refund, it would be closer to $50B. Still a huge sum.

Idk if it directly affects $BA but transports are weak.

My research is lagging for specifics, other than wages up for drivers and  pilots. Not good for Q3 reports. $DAL out with notes today

Non-advice:

Jan '21 150p are starting to look more and more attractive (own). Perhaps even summer 250p (don't own).

$BA is likely loaded to the MAX (couldn't resist) in your 401k via any mutual fund. 

Why would you not hedge in some way knowing what we know?

$BA is ~10% of the DOW. If it craters, it takes the DOW with it. Once the DOW starts to move, get out of the way or get steamrolled.

$BA $BA.d has recognized expected losses on the assumption that the MAX would receive regulatory approval 'early in the fourth quarter of 2019', which is conveniently vague.  More charges are coming very soon; likely a MAX production halt as current production = cash bleed.

While investors are bearish and have trimmed speculative longs (see the IPO wasteland), they are all hiding in big cap monopolies like $AAPL, $BA and $MSFT, and as such, the indices are barely budging. 

These monopolies, for the most part, got underlying bids from buybacks.

No 2019 bonuses for white-collar Boeing employees.
In February, Boeing paid Puget Sound region employees 2018 bonuses  totaling $429 million. The year before, it was $600 million.

Top leaders will still get 2019 bonuses via their long-term incentive plan.

The CEO is gone, and they have already felt the slump from that and recovered. They just grounded like 50 jets with cracks. $BA is solid. Twice, I’ve got in around $330 and rode it to the $370’s. If no other news comes. It will happen again. I’m in at 337 now

Add to that... it’s longterm holders have put their feet down. Which is why it’s held where it has every time. $BA is strong. Any long term investor are not worried about the next couple years. It didn’t get to $446 as a a high from traders.

The fighter pilot essentially uses bang-bang controler to stabilize unstable mode and takes many Gs but they are trained for that. Can't do that with passenger and continuous controller won't work, need bang-bang. My take, it will never work, MAX maybe finished. $BA

 put 14.4M shares into its pension fund.  They were supposed to be sold into the market though I can't verify this.  Given the fund's equity exposure of ~28% as of Dec. 2018 that'd be nearly 1/3 of the equity portion in $BA stock.
