Boeing delivered 79 planes in Nov which means $BA has to ship 106 in Dec. simply to meet lower-end of FY guidance. They've NEVER delivered >91 in a month. Warned on this when the share price was closer to $380. Grounded.

Here's the thing. I sold $BA calls at mid 4s. And it ran to 6+. If you are greedy then you resent it. If you love success then someone out there made 6 on it, and that is TERRIFIC. It was their risk. I made $$ and that person made $$, but never be envious. Could easy be a Loss.

Try changing your tickers to some more conservative less volatile ones like $msft $ba. I started trading with $168 and reached $380 this week day trading $msft and $nvda. Been booking $30, $50 gains quick. Not the best way to do it but it works for me. Also No OTMs. Mainly ATMs

Oh ya, I don't know how a company with the size $ba's balance sheet but just a sliver of positive book value can be said to be ""doing well.""  Also, it's tangible net worth is negative $10.9 billion.

Gold has been suppressed for years. Been up nicely since Oct with CBs buying to bolster balance sheets. At the top of a bubble, safe assets are discarded. Ppl rather own $BA at 140 and get an ""automatic"" 1% daily return. It can only go up.

In this 5-min chart I overlay one company's stock and one major US index ETF over the past 6 weeks. Note the almost 1:1 exact relationship. Guess which company and ETF these two are. The first to guess correctly can get a free premium membership for 1 week.

Seems that the MCAS system could be responsible again. Very interesting that these incidents typically happen to airlines of developing countries and could be due to a training discrepancy as opposed to an actual flaw in the $BA 737 Max aircrafts.

They needed a 'healthy' correction anyway. No need to pump $djia right now the trade deal is not ready yet. $ba in all likelihood should go down. But maybe not as low as people would like. And certainly not indefinitively. The artificial pumping of Dow is not over!!

$TSLA plan this weekend/monday was to load up on puts below 293, but premiums were way too expensive so avoided it. Short term target (this week) is 250 so if that hits i'll be pretty upset. Remember $TSLA fades are some of the best in option land, right along side $NFLX

At 00:14 US drone took off from UAE in stealth mode & violated Iranian airspace. It was targeted at 04:05 at the coordinates (25¬∞59'43""N 57¬∞02'25""E) near Kouh-e Mobarak.

We've retrieved sections of the US military drone in OUR territorial waters where it was shot down.

I suppose first, although semi's moved up on news as a whole, this was not a news gapper.  Today we had $BA, $FDX, and $WDC which all worked.  When in doubt check mult time frames. $AMD inside 30 worked.  For options, use 2nd candle as reference. .38 entry, .24 stop, went to .57.

Not even necessarily specific to $BA, but possibly to the industry as a whole. Guessing there probably isn't anything too major, like the 737 Max issues, but the amount of ""credit given"" for geometric similarity & any associated procedures/protocols are likely to change in future

This all comes down to regulatory capture IMHO, which is a hard variable to judge. I wouldn't be surprised if FAA allows return, but EU or China do not. In which case, $BA loses major market share to Airbus.

The problem is structural. Question is whether there's a software fix sufficiently acceptable to pilots and regulators. In a perfect world, regulators would send $BA back to the drawing board on design

It will never stop now.
They will never normalize.
Why? Because they can‚Äôt.
The global financial system cannot stand on its own.
Blowing ever higher asset bubbles is the only choice they have or risk an epic unwind.

$SQ and $DIS are expensive.  

My buy point for $DIS is $122.  

$SQ just watching.

I agree with you on $BA and $AAPL.  I like $BA but thinking of taking profits and buying it lower.

I like $AAPL below $200.

I am really cautious starting any new position.

$DIS is at an ATH but priced right w/ market cap of $236B

$AAPL unless they come out w/ game changing product - they'll be where they are

Jan '21 150p are starting to look more and more attractive (own). Perhaps even summer 250p (don't own).

$BA is likely loaded to the MAX (couldn't resist) in your 401k via any mutual fund.

$BA is ~10% of the DOW. If it craters, it takes the DOW with it. Once the DOW starts to move, get out of the way or get steamrolled.

$BA $BA.d has recognized expected losses on the assumption that the MAX would receive regulatory approval 'early in the fourth quarter of 2019', which is conveniently vague.  More charges are coming very soon; likely a MAX production halt as current production = cash bleed.

While investors are bearish and have trimmed speculative longs (see the IPO wasteland), they are all hiding in big cap monopolies like $AAPL, $BA and $MSFT, and as such, the indices are barely budging. 

These monopolies, for the most part, got underlying bids from buybacks.

In February, Boeing paid Puget Sound region employees 2018 bonuses  totaling $429 million. The year before, it was $600 million.

Top leaders will still get 2019 bonuses via their long-term incentive plan.
