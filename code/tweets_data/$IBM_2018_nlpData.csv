Tonight we celebrated the impact of my colleague, mentor & friend, Jon Iwata (@coastw). Sure, it was about his career at @IBM, but it was really about his impact on the world & the people in it.

MyPillow is a lost cause. He’s a Trumpanzee. And he’s got an ‘F’ with the BBB so he’s losing business. (A large reason he’s sticking with Faux News—the uneducated don’t know or care about the BBB)

While this is a good start, one of the biggest #design issues with #blockchain is which data to allow in. Garbage in, garbage out. Solutions include proof of work and shared consensus. Yet are these enough to ensure the data is trusted? Get it wrong + you miss much of the value.

But if use of an AI application results in improved accuracy or better service for the patient don’t we as physicians have an ethical obligation to push for adoption ASAP? 

It isn’t about protecting our jobs/income. It is about what is best for our patients.

I don’t like any ideas on replacing. Radiographers in  are not able to act as physicians in take care of pts (it is not just watching images...). AI could really replace us, but are we really let machines take care of us? I prefer human touch..

Just imagine on the fly MRI exam tailoring. For example: machine sees a lesion on the kidney on lumbar spine MRI and automatically adjusts the field of view and sequences  to evaluate the kidney lesion and make the diagnosis, saving an additional test down the road.

IMHO, many vendors miss that ‘loss-leader’ strategy, when it comes to infrastructures a service! 

I learned this strategy at my first job at McDonald’s HQ in 1995. They used to treat BigMac as loss leader. I believe now is McChicken ;)

In most cases you have to seed change with something, and that can often mean a specialist cloud sales team with a significant number of new hires. Biz has to look at ROI on retraining. (Big tech vendors have to at least partially retrain due to sheer scale of Sales.)

Lifting and shifting is one strategy, but I don’t think it’s the most common approach from the people I’ve talked to. More likely there is a hybrid approach being pulled together in a cloud-native fashion to manage across environments in a uniform way.

the gender problem is not new, but is worsening.
My mother trained as

 programmer in Portugal (early 70's).
During my study at 
@FC_UL
, mid 80's, we were +-60% female students, many lecturers were female too. 
Nowadays I'm ""lucky"" if I have 15% female students

The saving grace for

Agreed. I just see the open source movement in many cases as “developer knows best, let them play”. One of the problems is they play too long and we extend time-to-value. 2nd prob is “OK, I’ve played with Docker, I’m good. Let me look at Serverless now” #CIO Leadership is key.
