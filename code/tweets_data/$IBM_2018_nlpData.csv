 to look at this matter & go through entire thread.
Hope they will do the needful but if they don't then we have to think in other ways including administration's action for malign women in Social Media.

Geico have been getting a lot of complaints lately, my son and I have begun the process of talking with the General and have gotten some great estimates, so I think it's time to move on with The General, forget Geico.

Fox News is nothing but Trump state-run media. Trump's constant attack of our free press is wrong. Fox News is the most divisive organization in our country. Stop supporting their blatant lies by advertising on Fox. You have seen what organizing for a cause can do....

And THAT is the way to do it. I do every time I see this tweet. Take their slogans and find a word in it to tweet it back in their faces. It provides me with a much needed laugh. Some are more strongly worded than others, i.e. Take a trip to hell til you get off Fox on trivago.

IMHO, many vendors miss that ‚Äòloss-leader‚Äô strategy, when it comes to infrastructures a service! 

I learned this strategy at my first job at McDonald‚Äôs HQ in 1995. They used to treat BigMac as loss leader. I believe now is McChicken ;)

In most cases you have to seed change with something, and that can often mean a specialist cloud sales team with a significant number of new hires. Biz has to look at ROI on retraining. (Big tech vendors have to at least partially retrain due to sheer scale of Sales.)

Lifting and shifting is one strategy, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the most common approach from the people I‚Äôve talked to. More likely there is a hybrid approach being pulled together in a cloud-native fashion to manage across environments in a uniform way.
