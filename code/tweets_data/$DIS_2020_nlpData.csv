Feels dangerous. Narrative on $DIS has shifted and solid Disney+ comps could cause this to rip. 

I trimmed after latest run but think there is more to go. So many positives with bundling/cross selling/ new content. 

But if so obvious then maybe I am on wrong side of trade...

I'm short $DIS.  However:
$CMSCA core business is lower growth, more capital intensive, and has weaker moats.  $DIS is arguably under-earning due to heavy investment in new content. $DIS should definitely get a much higher multiple.

I do think $DIS ability to scale and achieve profitability on DTC is much more real than Netflix. Return on content spend should be significantly higher given their proven franchises. The fact that they own their library is an advantage too.

Today I was going to add to $ABBV, instead I opened a new position to $DIS. This was the exact reason. Disney beautiful moat.

Was looking at $DIS new proxy statement tonight. The median employee  was paid $52,184. This is up from $46,127 last year due to ""investments the Company made in our employees in fiscal 2019."" 

I think you get some credit for that!

CEO is still paid too much.

This is the reason why they are opposing CAA, they wanted Hindus to decrease but they think CAA will do otherwise.

Don't worry, you will never win this battle.

Investors who took advantage of “bad news rumors” in 2018 made a small fortune even with a modest position.

Still like the long $DISCA paired against short $AMCX - although a bit more nervous on Discovery heading in.

What I love about $DIS long is there are liquid ways to hedge out legacy media risk. And fortunately, we have been on the right side of both so far.

1 thing I do when I’m starting a position is allocating a # to that trade and scaling in 

Total commitment = $2500
Starter $250
Confirmation add in
Goes against me - add at my next level. No more than 20% of total allocation - 

If it doesn’t work I can lose 20% of my commitment

$dis said the drop in operating profit from the closures of the two parks would amount to less than $200 million. If they remain closed for two months.

Ah yes, the old diversifying theme parks with movies theatres that are going to be jam packed with people.

I own $dis for clients but given dis+ burn, theatre merch and park revenues tanking, and a lot of debt after fox, it's in a tough spot for the next few quarters.

You like $HLT better than $MAR? I feel like that would be my pick in hotels. I'm also interested in $EXPE, but too chicken given possible $GOOG/L disintermediation. 

I'm a big fan of $DIS, though I acknowledge it's a long-term play, not something that's likely to pay off soon.

$DIS Down 50%. 5.5B of cash, 38B of debt. 60% of income comes from “parks, experiences and products” which is taking a big hit. Expect the “media segments” to shine as everyone is at home. They will come out stronger post COVD. At 15X TTM P/E this is a good LT hold.

For @YahooSportsNBA I wrote about how if the NBA is serious about bringing the entire league to a single site, there is only one place that makes sense: Walt Disney World.

Before you laugh, read on why WDW is uniquely positioned to host the entire NBA:

What is there view on $DIS? A bit surprised stock trading at $100 price when parks closed, cruises stopped, etc. Price is trading around the same as when people were scared about ESPN viewer #'s dropping in the 2016-2018 period. Thought stock would be lower.

You're not going to like my answer, but that really depends on the investor. FWIW, I'm long $DIS and not $NFLX, but I've consistently been wrong on $NFLX (for years), so I might not be the best person to ask about it.

I owned $MVL at that time as well. Great pick by the Fool.

In fairness to yourself, do you have any idea where you reallocated that money? If it was something that's outperformed $DIS like say $AAPL or $AMZN, you might not have as many regrets as you think.

sell it in theatres
sell it in parks
sell it in merch
sell it in DIS+

$NFLX makes $1 of content they: 
sell it in $NFLX.

Disney is a world leader in liscensed child/infant tombstone sales. 

Elsa Frozen Child Tombstone earned $DIS $2.9B in 2019 alone. 
With COVID-19, the House of Mouse has a big child tombstone payday coming. 

One dead child’s bootleg tombstone costs Disney ~$2000. Is that ok?

Sister (25 years old, dietitian) just asked what the hot stock picks are these days because she’s ready to start investing.

I told her to consider investing long-term in a broad market ETF, maybe one that tracks the S&P 500.

She asked me what an ETF and the S&P 500 are.

Most people think this stock has been garbage, I think @Ultra_Calls picked out a solid company. The R/S is temporary, should go drop the lowest to 5.21 here, if it does, it should be the launch pad to blow it past $10. Holding here, will add more on drops.

I'd love to see that combo, but I think you nailed it. $DIS has $5bn cash, $MSFT has $136bn. Disney has relatively more debt on it than MSFT too - MSFT at ~$59bn and DIS at $39bn. Plus deal would be ~20% of DIS market cap and 2-3% of MSFT's.

$DIS may have spiked up on earnings, but I don't think it is done quite yet. $DIS reported a net loss of $4.72B while EPS came in at 0.08, their first loss & lowest EPS since 2001 . So why has it gone up & why do I think it will keep going up???

I posted an $AMZN chart as a “quadruple top” on Friday & FinTwit lost its mind, calling it everything from an ascending triangle, to a flag, to a cup, a “shelf,” and even a ‘W.’

In today’s Lund Loop newsletter I settle this issue once and for all.

Some might cancel, but few would I imagine. I don't know, to me everything $DIS does right now should be driving Disney+ subs. Everything. Worry about getting that number up and making it such a great value that no one minds when they raise the price in a few years. JMHO.

Let the others chase $DIS at $130 and $BA at $180 and $MAR at $97. No thanks. Those companies will face headwinds for the next 6-12 months or longer. I’m sticking with the stocks that are growing 50-100% with or without a pandemic.

Something rarely mentioned w/ Substack's model is creator lock-in. 

Bc it's email, it's easy for Substack writers to leave the platform with their entire audience (mailing list).

Creators can & will go to the cheaper alternative when it becomes available (open source + Stripe)

Buffett bought a significant amount of $DIS stock at a split-adjusted price of $.31/share... In 1967 he sold at $.48 cents per share.

I'm sure that haunts him to this day.

The bright side is that you can come back from a mistake like that and still be one of the GOAT.

Mechanizing process can already be seen at work in the film, in publicity & propaganda. 

The Disney films are produced by what is essentially a factory process, the work being done partly mechanically and partly by teams of artists who have to subordinate their individual style.

I like $DIS as a long-term investment but it should get active in M&A in the electronic gaming space. There are some quality electronic gaming companies that Disney can acquire at great value like $TTWO. That will be a huge boost to $DIS top line growth.

In 1966, @WarrenBuffett bought 5% of $DIS for $4 million

That position is worth $12 billion today

A 3,000-bagger!

Unfortunately, Warren sold that position for $6 million in 1967

Even the greatest investors of all time make big mistakes

We suspect Mulan is headed for under 3.5 million units in the US, or sub-$100 million of revenue to Disney — likely below Trolls (despite benefiting from higher price point).

That's a whopping 25000 bagger...

Accounting for $DIS dividends reduces some of that delta but wow...unbelievable!

They're just not going ""all-in"" on your timeline or exactly as you think they should.

The steaming strategy is clearly working well (ahead of your expectations by a mile).

Perhaps a partnership but only one company makes sense as an acquirer for $PTON and thats $AAPL. $DIS could do a cash and stock deal very easily but they don’t have the synergies like $AAPL.

$FUN and $SIX seem to give you 2-3x vs. $DIS maybe gives you 20-30% over a couple years? I think $SIX and $FUN have good access to capital, decent businesses, and probably compound similar to $DIS.

 is long $SIX, which is a similar bet. I think these are pretty high quality companies. Sure $DIS is higher quality but don't compete really.

Very interesting. Reflecting on my experience, we’ve been consuming less of $NFLX and more of prime video, espn+ and YouTube tv + Peacock (for English premier league).

When $DIS comes out with their Marvel and Star Wars TV content, I‘d think $NFLX might lose more share.

I think $DIS is *almost* always worth buying.  

Obviously it’s business was decimated by Covid, but it’s one of the most resilient companies in the world, and it’s got the best IP in entertainment.

It is time for any $DIS Q4 mailbag questions you may have. Ask any questions you have regarding The Walt Disney Company, Disney Parks, Disney+, and whatever else.

At the end of the day, it is about how well do you monetize content and what your return on content spend is. $DIS has figured that out. $NFLX is trying to figure it out. 

Across the entire enterprise, $DIS revenue and cash flow per customer, much higher than $NFLX.

$NFLX proven, $AAPL has most to prove but also ""layup"" with assets to deploy (captive distribution, creator relationships, capital), $DIS needs to follow thru on subs + content scale (hence thread), $AMZN closest in scale & commercialization. All could be in successful 5 set.

Same reason why the studio had such high margins compared to peers. I say had because of COVID. The issue $DIS faces is they are likely overmonetiizng.

It’s $NFLX vs. $DIS 

$PENN is a large brick and mortar traditional casino that is trying to break into digital, whereas $DKNG is the digital-first, industry leader (co-leader), that has a track record of co-dominating every market with Fanduel.

Today, ESPN announced they were laying off 300 people. It's the 5th mass headcount reduction since 2013.

16% of ESPN's subscribers have churned since 2009 (99M to 83MM)

$DIS's future is DTC. ESPN needs to move major-sports content to ESPN+ or watch ESPN slowly die.

$DKNG has more cash than a bank, and a partnership with its most valuable investor $DIS aka ESPN. I’ll bet on ESPN over $PENN. $PENN has toxic casinos and I’d rather be digital than bricks and sticks! Also, $DKNG is global and has MJ on the board- hello NBA pump in Dec!

Agreed. Main reason I’m long $TGT $DIS $AAPL. Love the idea of a “value” stock that potentially has a long runway of underestimated growth ahead of it (Shipt, Disney+/Hulu, billions of R&D spending) in addition to my high growth names.

New- $PTON $TSLA $LULU 
Old (but strong)- $AAPL $DIS $NKE

For better or for worse, when I think of strong brands, I think of the following:

1) Status symbols  
2) Cult-like following & fanboys 
3) Price inelastic (premium)

They earn these through design and top customer sat.

If I could add one I’d say $DIS.  Of this list I’d say the strongest brand is $AAPL but the most loyal is $TSLA

$DIS is a really good call! Love it. $SE has always been your jam, and it’s been a great call. I’m new to stock investing as of March. I’m kicking myself for not learning earlier...exposure for the kids and time on their side is my goal. Each year, add to existing or new ones.
