IMO the GPU-less ‚Äúfuture‚Äù is ways off.  With $GOOG/ $VZ backing off their fiber rollouts, hard to see great swaths of this country (e.g. non-urban/rural) being able to access the necessary bandwidth.  5G *might* alleviate, but with net-neutrality blown up, color me skeptical.

Can't shake this LONG term thought:
Want $AAPL's customers? Pay toll..

Want $AMZN custs? Pay toll.

1. Lots of recent OI in the name
2. ER not until May 30 so I don't think that's the reason.
3. Cheap 5G play when considering other players like $VZ and $T.

All of our stock positions are listed on my pinned tweet, and these are ones I want to increase on the next opportunity: $GOOG $CURLF $VZ $TERP (in order of how close they currently are to prices I'm willing to pay). I also want to get back in $CGNX, and maybe add 1 new position.

Nice. Meanwhile $T has been flatlining -- is $VZ company growth outlook that much better? T does have a juicy ~6.5% dividend that is safe from what I understand (though I do not follow telcos closely).

You‚Äôre going to want to go back if you live within a major city. The coverage in the downtown portions of SD, LA, and SF is spotty at best, causing inconvenient issues like navigation lagging. I would deal w/ the annoying flux of $VZ costs to have my uninterrupted service back.

Dunno. I switched from $VZ to $TMUS when I lived in WA. Service was generally okay for $TMUS in cities but outside of cities it was really bad and $VZ and $T were much better.

Moved to FL and $TMUS didn‚Äôt work at all where I live. Had to resign up for $VZ and am impressed so far

(2/2) you were in for the div anyways & got you 4.3% but b/c you sold the call you suck in another ~1.75% income. If they get called, you made 7% on the name anyways & covered your annual income need & a name like $VZ, if bought for yield, then you're buying more lower anyways

(1/2) Consider something like $VZ, which a lot of retirees no doubt own for the 4% div (no some crazy move to the upside). You could buy shares here for a 4.3% yield (think as a bond equivalent) and sell the Oct. 60s for ~1.05 if shares move against you...

Yes. Also if New $TMUS does go through, I think the NewCo will be a formidable competitor to $VZ and $T and $SFTBY should benefit from that - but also importantly and perhaps more importantly to investors in the short-run, SB would de-consolidate $40 bn of $S debt.

's point, $t or $vz purchasing a cable plant could lead to some short term increase in competition because it might reduce some of the existing local scale benefits/regulatory capture in some markets.  That said, I think long term convergence is a plus for cable.

1. Market will go up.
2. Momentum players will swarm momo like $BYND. I think $LK could be another one.
3. Dividend stocks will be moving higher slow and steady. I‚Äôm heavily invested in defensive stocks like $T, $VZ and $DIS.
4. Wounded bellwethers will recover...$BA, $JNJ, $AMGN

$T increased their free cash flow forecast (FCF) for this year to $28B from $26B. $VZ should do close to that in FCF. They are in the top 5 of all companies. Higher FCF than even $MSFT.

All these 3 cos do is compete for each other‚Äôs customers. $T has shit svs in the west, $VZ has best svs but by far the most expensive and $TMUS willing to mortgage their future for new sub growth. They have no Intl opps and spend like mad so others can thrive on their network

But it could take a long time, won't cover the whole footprint, and many people think that if this starts to look economical then if you're $VZ you probably want the cable backhaul capability that $CHTR already has. Also the dif in data moving btwn cable and telco is humongous.

Also winning 150 MHz of C-Band would likely require DT lending.

Hi Ryan - For $FB and $GOOG, most is growth and privacy capex - a lot of which would be fixed. $VZ and $T have taken debt for capex to sustain their positions.
Shouldn't a biz be considered asset heavy only when maintenance capex is high or recurring growth capex is ""required""?

I would add, $VZ is s/t bearish, and that is without the main market even breaking low. Note the overhead 50dma, and the 200dma, with a legacy gap to the $56s.

Better to auction 280 MHz all at once. CBA wanted to squeeze out all proceeds it could.

Media company owned by #1 US cableco $CMCSA says fixed wireless broadband won't be a competitive threat to cable? What a surprise...

$VZ and $T hyped 5G up way too much, mmWave coverage awful.

So basically everyone benefits but $T. Maybe why they are quoted in that piece for potentially being interested in an MVNO deal!

Im sure they are getting that range in tests or they wouldnt say it.  Once the x55 launches with new module we will see how it works.  $vz pretty much stopped investing capex in 5g home waiting for these new launches so it must be a major improvement

$vz is waiting for the x55 and a new module to make 5g get better service from longer distances.   They have purposely kept 5g home to the original 4 cities using proprietary 5g tech and have only 1 city chicago testing out 5g home with x50 chip to prepare for big launch

Agreed. $VZ hyped 5G too much, cable valuations in 2017 got needlessly hurt because it was too hyped. Now there is no hype.

IMO if $TMUS / $S gets approved, need to start baking some competition in.

0% impact from OneWeb currently; totally fair, but need to be aware long-term.

What's a timeframe on that? Because $VZ has consistently been pushing back 5G home broadband deployment.

Also - you really believe in mmWave? Coverage has been awful to start, like, only available on a few street corners in only dense cities awful.

Upon deep reflection:

1. $AAPL (phone, reminders, maps, headphones)
2. $INTU (Pro series and Quickbooks)
3. $GOOG (Gmail, calendar, maps, search)
4. $DELL (work laptop)
5. $TWTR (investment/entertainment)

Special mention to $TMUS, $VZ, $ATUS, $ED for cell, WiFi and utilities.

They only work in extreme hotspots now that‚Äôs the problem. Where‚Äôs the coverage? $VZ has launched in these cities for months and coverage still almost nothing.

Makes sense. But then why is $VZ billing this as ‚Äú5G Built Right‚Äù and implying that 5G mobility is available across the country? The same 5G they wanted to charge $10 extra for.
