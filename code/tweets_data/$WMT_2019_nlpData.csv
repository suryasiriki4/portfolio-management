Walmart didn't announce much better results than a handful of competitors. Seriously, part of any stock move is which day they talk.

Also $WMT is a staple and $TGT is discretionary. And everyone is wrong about Target except me (which almost never makes sense but does this time).

I bet you like your $WMT pants. The $LULUs would be better.

I've never run the numbers of ""shirt that lasts 3yrs vs $TGT shirt good for 3mos of gym wear"" but the pants have similar staying power vs cut-rate khakis. I'm guessing the economics are better than they seem.

You have to think backwards from “capitalism works”. If Bernie and Chuck knew anything about running $WMT they would be running Walmart. 

Forcing Walmart stores to become outdated will cost a million jobs, give or take, over about 15yrs. 

But, sure, let these guys run it.

Interesting tidbit from Levi-Strauss IPO filing: Its share of revenue coming from big retailers like Walmart and Target has declined from 30% in 2016 to 27% last year. That's nearly 1/3 of revenue from accounts that can be ""terminated at any time"" and pushing their own labels

$WMT is no longer a straight step down the social ladder. They would be more impacted by the gov't shutdown than other players but if consumers are spending less generally it's not bullish for $WMT.

1) $AMZN.  More transcript catch up.  $TGT e-commerce accelerated YoY to 31% in the fourth quarter vs. prior year at 29% and best Q4 comp in 14 years.  Comparing $TGT, $WMT, $W, etc. to $AMZN in the fourth quarter is not a good look for $AMZN.

I'm not sure $AMZN has thought this through. If I'm a manufacturer selling wholesale to many retailers (of which Amazon was once one), I'm not going risk my relationship with $WMT (for instance) by undercutting what it sells my product for. I'll be forced to price at MSRP 1/

besides the high prices, I hate $KR discount card crap, they keep track of your groceries then jack up the price on the items you frequently buy. HEB and $WMT don't do that. Besides $AMZN now delivers groceries through $WFM wine, meat, etc, can't beat their customer service man.

Problem is leverage. LBO-style debt killed $KHC not purchase price. Which is $KO has not suffered, low debt.

I will. It was great perspective from an industry expert (and encouraging for holders of $KR $WMT or $CVS). Btw, about ""just closed CNBC"", I keep a small TV on my desk on all day but muted so I don't miss the really good stuff, but still avoid the 75% noise and can get work done.

Voice ordering is $WMT's version of the Imperial Drone delivery system. Drive up is the deal. $35b run rate in grocery now. By far the preferred way to buy grocery online (to the extent there is one).

Amazon has a distribution point problem.

Walmart can offer Order & Pick-up to 69% of America from stores right now. 800 stores can deliver, meaning 36% of the US can get fresh food delivered from $WMT. 

Customers like pick-up.

It's nice for $AMZN to have grocery ambitions but they are currently a non-factor.

As a diabetic I can say not all insulin is alike. Some forms are much stronger (therefore a need to use less). Some act faster acting than others, etc. BTW, there are several forms of insulin at $WMT that require no prescription.

$WMT doesn't have the network effects to pull this off. 

Strange, though, that $FB would want to bypass $V and $MA while at the same time asking them to invest in this idea.

Walmart can offer Order & Pick-up to 69% of America from stores right now. 800 stores can deliver, meaning 36% of the US can get fresh food delivered from $WMT. 

Customers like pick-up.

It's nice for $AMZN to have grocery ambitions but they are currently a non-factor.

Amazon is its own thing. I've always said there's about a 30% range of valuation you can justify for $AMZN. I compare Amazon's retail operations to $WMT and $TGT. Amazon has ~0% stacked growth in physical. They did 1% in Q1. 

Prime is important. Stores also matter.

$AMZN & $WMT will always have more pricing power. But the grow revenue but not profits until you reach scale mantra on Wall Street only works if you produce CF. $AMZN had AWS which is a distinct factor as well. Most of these biz models will fail.

If $AMZN bought $TGT the combined entity would have under 7% of the current US grocery market. As a percent of total US retail, the combined chain would be <1/2 the size of $WMT

Reality doesn't really matter but I don't think this is the kind of power Sherman was addressing.

So maybe the focus should be elsewhere, like $WMT or $AMZN or $MCD ??
Also plenty of paces have seen a better economy post min wage boosts, in the last 3 years.

Fun fact: Kmart was the largest retailer by revenue in America for one quarter. $WMT and Kmart both surpassed Sears in 1990.

Bonus Fact: When my dad would tell me ""A dirty story shouts F-You to customers"" he was generally referring to Kmart.

Retire from what? Macke Assorted needs me.

I mean, I think I'm working. I pay people. But if this was my last day I'd show up and do the same thing on Monday. Bc $WMT earnings are coming.

(By the way, my confusion on this point is a worthwhile life goal. Retirement is insane.)

And as far as $TSLA on Friday that really may have had more to do with Solar City's stupidity with $WMT that was egged on by David Einhorn on short side. 

AND Einhorn shouldn't be telling ANYONE how to run a solar company after HE DESTROYED SunEdison

Nothing of the sort. Walmart said its piece. Nothing incongruent between demands in the litigation claim & statement. It’s clear from ex. 248 that $WMT doesn’t believe $tsla capable of performing on contract. $tsla clearly can’t afford a war of words, silent, so joint statement.

You may also want to go back and read Home Depot's report. They beat on one thing - EPS...by less than the percentage of shares they took out of float through buybacks. And guidance was downright awful. $WMT did crush. And it's the one stock I'm going to add long on a pullback.

 CEO Doug McMillon is a coward. If he was consistent in his views they'd also ban Coca-Cola products and anything with added sugar in it as about 80,000 people die of Diabetes every year. How many of THOSE people are Walmart customers? $WMT

Reminds me of when Walmart started offering a bunch of generic drugs for $4 a month back in 2006. Some rivals scoffed, but the $WMT discount plan has persisted and caused changes in the market.
wsj.com
Wal-Mart Cuts Prices for Many Generic Drugs to $4
Wal-Mart promised to cut the price of nearly 300 generic drugs to $4 for a 30-day supply. After a test in Florida, the discount retailer plans to expand the program to other states next year.

Fred is willfully ignorant of the recent $TSLA solar news like the excellent

Negative press almost certainly has curtailed prospective customer interest in Tesla Solar resulting in today's new pricing plan.

Now subtract large, concentrated family holdings like $WMT, $BRK, $EPD, etc. and I think you'll find a large portion of the rest of the mkt doesn't trade or make it into actively managed funds.

I love it Bc I know $WMT doesn’t have a choice. This role has been thrust upon Walmart. The company is disrupting government with capitalism. Walmart is thus setting policy and standards by default. 

If the government wants the job back all they have to do is govern.

$WMT is in a huge rising channel on the weekly, and there is some pullback from this big earnings run - as expected. $150 is a stretch, but not impossible, and the expiration date allows another ER run/beat. This is a pretty low risk/high reward with the call being so cheap.

I finally trimmed back my $COST in excess of a mid 30x PE ratio.  Never a cheap stock but every year or two you can pick it up sub 30.  $WMT might have a little more runway

The key (and most difficult) question is, does being in the top 1% of knowledge in a stock make you money?

ie. Would you rather be in top 1% of a large-cap, well-covered stock like $WMT, or in the top 30% of a micro cap liquidating with $1.00 / share NAV priced at $0.50?

To put 85.5 Billion in perspective, it takes 2,200,000 employees at Walmart working 24/7/365 days a year to make 1/14 of that in profit for $WMT a year. So basically 14 years of profit. I hope rates are Well Behaved.

I'm with you guys, look at how badly they have been lagging $aapl, $msft, $goog, $Wmt, $cost, $tgt. I think you could argue this is longer term digestion of the run up from 2017-8 but it feels heavy every day. My theory is someone has been selling, look at how tight the range is.

Yo guys what I find fascinating is its two biggest cloud rivals $msft $googl and its three biggest big box retailers $Wmt $cost $tgt have been smoking it on a relative basis. Remember the death of everything because of $amzn? Forced their rivals to adapt.

Brick-n-mortar retailers will find it increasingly difficult to get sales traction. Growth would go to online retailers, as millennials' share of the population increases. 

With 1-2 hour delivery by online retailers, advantage of physical shops is reducing.

If I'm $WMT I don't bother looking at $FDX but instead look at Bradley Jacobs & $XPO. XPO is the #2 largest global contract logistic player, #2 largest freight brokerage player, and #1 NA last mile provider. They have leading logistics for inevitable drone delivery as well
