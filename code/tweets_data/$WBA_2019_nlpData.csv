 well done.

I've been going to games on my own for a couple of years since my dad passed away. I have great friends outside of football, but unfortunately they dont follow the Baggies. I have been a lucky one and not been affected as once in the ground I have a family of 26k.

I guess if you know by the time you pass through Derby you know you're not going to make it, you could always stop off at Derby's Moor Farm to watch a bit of football...

What is the point of this? The guy's literally the only winger we had that could consistently put a ball into the box. Not to mention the fact that he changes games whenever he comes onto the pitch. Look at Sheffield Utd away. Millwall away. Birmingham home...

To be fair the clubs probably parting over 100k a week on 4 strikers with 2 not even kicking a ball. We need to sell to invest. Pullis is Mowbray of old, cutting the cloth and trying to remain competitive. It‚Äôs gunna be hard from now on. Pullis will leave in the summer regardless

Not an apologist for Pulis but he brought in Evans (could have sold for ¬£18m) Livermore, J Rod, Philips, Rondon, Gibbbs, Barry Hegazi ..back bone of current team & some of best players in the division hardly ruined us ..need a bit of balance

Don't bother.
Worst performance of the season.
Too many players out of position.

If Lawrence were to start ahead of James against Slovakia then Giggs really isn't watching the championship games. If the two wingers who start were Matondo and Wilson because Brooks is injured then fair enough.

In those 104 appearances he was a key player in taking us up the Premier League for the first time. He also scored the first against Palacd on the promotion day. Whether he should have been sacked is debatable but Big Dave is undoubtedly a club legend #WeNotMe

No, we don‚Äôt!! There‚Äôs a small minority of deluded fans who think because players are in Blue and White they‚Äôre the best in that position but most of us know we‚Äôre overachieving to be where we are. Just need to look at Stoke and Swansea.

I got to know Thompson well - he had a vision & the ability to take us forward - relegation to Div 1 when he took over - promotion to PL 3 years later was his legacy! That was impressive! Peace only wanted to build his portfolio - don't link them!

TBH Matt I'm also quite bemused at the timing, he should've had the rest of the season at least but I think the change would have been inevitable in the summer. Our home record, with the squad we have, was far from where it should be and our only (annoying) tactic had been sussed

I think the way he's spent so much and failed with Fulham in the top flight needs to be considered too. I have my doubts if Jokanovic will work within tight budgets. Both Watford and Fulham were bankrolled.

Tough decision. Loan game can affect a team, losing Harvey Barnes, quite rightly recalled by LCFC, a turning point
Solid, expressive away, stunted at home, Gayle's ban affected him, rely on 38yr old Gareth Barry, says a lot

Best squad in the division and they should be well clear at the top, they aren‚Äôt, coach sacked. Simple. Colour has absolutely nothing to do with it.... lazy journalism.....

Its not about colour, it's about a coach not wanted by the board to continue his role. It was an odd decision regardless seeing they were 4th but still, if it was about colour they wouldn't have hired him in the first place would they? Media using non existent racism as a tool.

This idea that the decision to sack him was racially motivated baffles me. Firstly, why did they give him the job in the first place. Also, despite not thinking they should have sacked him, there has been an upturn in results since he left

This is part of an initiative by @WBA to try to tackle isolation & loneliness within our #AlbionFamily and local community

Many reasons-physical/mental health worries.
Or you just find yourself alone. 

If you or anyone you know would benefit, send an email to address on flyer.

I think the Derby thing is fair but to originally market the offer as giving you greater priority on away games was stupid and actually false. The loyalty points advance was always a daft idea

Not a Blues fan but this whole points deduction thing stinks when you know some of the cash rich clubs are getting away with murder. It's the same with the bank, owe them 100 quid and they will hound you, owe the 100 million and they invite you for coffee.

There is no place for discrimination in society and social media is not an exception to those rules. We find this behaviour abhorrent.

Run an away credit system. Rolling 2 season duration then credits drop off. Start low ticket allocation at 10 away credits etc (or less ) and work down if unsold  ( 1 credit per away ticket bought )  any returns get  credits removed. Sorted..

Can you name and shame the 'fAnS' who returned tickets? Should keep them away from Deepdale, maybe its a good thing we didn't make the play offs, they'll only come out their shells again . Ridiculous and an embarrassment to the club. You'd expect this from bloody Blackpool!

The decision to get rid of big Dave was,in my opinion, the correct one. But the shambolic way we've gone about a replacement is a joke. Serious questions need asking of the people who run the club. Problem is,apart from Jenkins,we dont see or hear from them.

 ¬∑ 27 Apr 2019
FT| West Brom 2 v 1 Millers.

#rufc's brave fight for @SkyBetChamp survival comes to an end, as defeat at The Hawthorns condemns them to relegation.

There was hope for the Millers, who took the lead through Robertson, but Rodriguez and Harper complete a turnaround for the hosts.

Its a piece of genius to release the kit this early. Gets on board with the play off run in, kits in time for summer holidays. Why would they miss out on the chance to sell this kit? Nothing to do with cash.

Having a job and somewhere to live is key in any ex-offender's rehabilitation. Better that we give everyone an opportunity to contribute in our society. We don't all start with the same opportunities in life.

A few reasons why it was wise to delete this tweet 

1) You finished 16th.
2) We beat you twice this year.
3) You finished 25 points behind us.
4) Your season was over in Feb.
5) 46 games. Just 45 goals.

Trying to score isn‚Äôt a bookable offence, no.  But if you throw yourself into a challenge anywhere on the pitch, fail to win the ball and only make contact with an opposition player, it can be a bookable offence.  Gayle wasn‚Äôt booked for ‚Äòtrying to score‚Äô.

To say we didnt have HRK, Gayle, Livermore, lost Brunt, J Rod and Johansen during the match, and played the majority of the tie with 10 men and still beat them is a testament to your coaching. Most teams would have folded, we fought the end. Thank you Jimmy #BoingBoing

Last thing we need is a new keeper.
Jed Steer has been excellent since he was given his chance. Kalinic is an international who was unlucky to come into a struggling side. Might be an idea to send Nyland out on loan to get game time next season.

We have produced the programme for the last two seasons, so you must have subscribed with the previous publisher. We strive to ensure delivery pre match. Midweek games are tough as we generally print on the day of the game, so those issues can arrive post match.

Brummie Road Ender from 1981, standing just to the left of the goal about half way up the stand with my mate and her dad. The excitement of getting ready to go to the match on Saturday mornings and catching the 448, then the 74 or 79 to The Hawthorns. Great memories.

He hasn‚Äôt got away with murder, I agree there were some chances where he should have scored, but most strikers will miss some chances given to them in games, but I sympathise because he simply didn‚Äôt have the service and pulis‚Äôs tactics didn‚Äôt help one bit.

Absolute honour to work with premier league legend, what a top guy Julian is.
Learnt so much from him, back in the pro game is where he belongs.
Cant wait to get started with Karl was an obvious choice and one that will continue to push this amazing club on and reach its goals.

All the best Ken!

Absolutely unplayable when hes on his game. Unfortunately didnt see it often enough here, but that's the reason he cost 8m, not 30. If he plays to his top level consistently then hes a top half Premiership player. If Bilic can get it out of him it's a bargain

The club have said at the Assembly that poor signal is symptomatic of lots of people in one place at one time and that they aren't of a mind to spend money trying to improve this as people on their phones during games potentially worsens the atmosphere, which I agree with.

I think it's not specific to albion. But I do believe the over all effect on the entire game in England is horrific. It has brought about things like the need for VAR. Prioritising the arm chair fan over the passion of the moment, and the at ground supporter. I hate that!

We‚Äôve got the wind in our sails from that win over Forest, and given that we‚Äôre back at the Hawthorns for this one, I think it could be a breeze. 

Just need to be wary of players like Jed Wallace, who can fire shots off from distance.

I honestly don't get how johnstone is still our keeper. I'd play bond over him every single time. Johnstone is a liability I'm afraid. He will have one or two great games in 10 and its just not good enough.

Yet johnstone single handedly won us and kept us in games last season and was one the keepers who made the most saves in the league... look at the facts before you slate someone. I'm not saying bond isn't a good keeper but to say johnstone is a liability is ridiculous.

Best wishes to the greatest Academy Manager Mark Harrison who leaves West Bromwich Albion F.C. producing more England players than many top clubs. A man of principles, values, and a great coach (over 25years). His name will Echo WBA training Ground and WBA Academy forever.

Absolutely pal. The GK experts could do worse than look at Stoke‚Äôs highlights this season. Their international has already conceded 2 worse than anything SJ has ever done in a #wba shirt, out of 4 very questionable gaols. JL has been class so far & balances FK & RS very well

You look at players who you play against and think, wow, how good would they be to be a  Baggie..?
Watching Romaine last year for Brentford, was exactly that scenario....
The fact he bleeds blue and white stripes only makes this signing so important...

Worst referee and linesman in the league. 

No handball for Krovinovic. 
No penalty for Pereira. 
Giving fouls all over the pitch for both sides that weren't fouls. 
Bookings that were never bookings.

WBA need more belief in themselves, but move the ball around well

Hope it works out for you Appy. Lincoln are a club on an upward trajectory rather than some of the unfortunate positions you've had to manage at previous poorly run clubs.

Wish you nothing but success

Brunty has absolutely earned that exhalted respect, 375+ games with class and talent will do that.
No question Brunty's technical skill sets him apart.
Still, by far the best dead ball exponent at the club, and in so many ways Romaine can see Brunty as a role model

Whilst at Tranmere first time round before he signed for you, he was unbelievable. His goal at Goodison was pure class. Koumas had fantastic talent, its a shame that he  didn't achieve what he could have done. Still a pleasure to watch on his day

The cruyff turn goal against Belgium yet again has saved his career and earned him 4 seasons at the Albion shocking Colin  luckiest footballer and man on this planet! Think I‚Äôd be more happier if wolves won the champions league

What Blackburn charge us is nothing to do with what we charge fans, we've never charged Blackburn fans ¬£40, they were just hoping to cash in on a big away following and its backfired a little, near on 3,000 is still decent support.

Yes they can. Technically you add the 3 points for a win to the 27 points that they have already claimed and it will take them to 30 points which will be two points more than the 2nd placed team. Frankly I would have thought that you have known that.

 I find it quite laughable how superior some of your fanbase believe you are to the rest of the league, you're only 2 points above a number of teams and you've drawn at home to Charlton, Milwall, Reading and Barnsley. You're far from too good for this division.

Conor is talented and class...
Rare combo, not to complain, but to impress by performance..
Cannot recall WBA in decades beign stronger at full back.. Ferguson, Furlong, Townsend, Gibbs....
Just keep impressing Conor, the only way.....

True, but its out of our hands.
Would love it to be any different, but playing the loan roulette wheel,  any 'smart' parent club have to put in the  January return clause..
Baggies are a great loan club, coached well, players are nurtured.
Like Barnes though, return is inevitable

And we could have lost those games, but we didn‚Äôt. There is no ‚ÄúShould have‚Äù in this league, or in the Premiership. If that is the case we ‚Äú Should‚Äù expect to be hammered in most games if we go up, as that is how most prem teams look at promoted sides. Be positive!

We've played it a bit safe here I think. Good options on the bench. Away at the league leaders, I suppose it's sensible. I'd have loved us to start Luongo, Forestieri and Nuhiu, 2 up top but then we'd probably get hammered. Difficult one to judge IMO.

Clarity of personnel and shape help.

60‚Äô | Albion 1-1 Brentford.

We've started the second-half well.

Edwards and Livermore have had efforts saved, and HRK fired a volley wide.

O'Shea has also come on for his Baggies league debut - replacing the injured Bartley.
