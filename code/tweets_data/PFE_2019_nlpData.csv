I assume the analysts aren't going to change mkt share % until more data on PFE/SLDB which is a bit away.  Hoping for at least a positive uD update at JPM to get a bit of a boost. No clue how much we rise on LGMD data, or when exactly it shows up.  Hopefully back to 160+ soon.

Jeff, I think you are likely right. The current models I've seen give SRPT NO credit for any DMD lead either.  They just flippantly dole out 33% to PFE/SLDB for trying.  I'm in the camp that believes SPRT has a 1-2+ yr lead over both and being first mover is worth something IMO.

another great article. thx Terry. Given NVS/PFE drugs focus on V in contrast to Voxelotor, would you concur that a joint study would be a natural? If so, then is PFE a logical candidate for GBT buyout? I dont see Voxelotor and PFE/NVS VOC drugs as competitors but complementary.

Totally agree, but it‚Äôs also a proprietary software tool that (according to other tweets) requires 75 PFE hours to implement and unsupported DB changes. That‚Äôs not quite the polished solution you can just throw up on github.

Nice spin. Congratulations, you hired people. Track records shows $PFE has spent $100B on research to yield $30B in organic sales. This is far from excellence. $PFE would be nothing without stellar M&A.

If they are seeing it in 70% or so that would wisely be included if you had a fast to market strategy and were excluding the other 30% initially as $SRPT did, points to PFE construct being a problem. If happening to the 30% they neglected to exclude, then somewhat expected/feared

Joe - any insights on the immune response to microD PFE trial and risk for SRPT - is SRPT microD same as PFE, or different that it may not generate an immune response?  Interesting that out of 5 patients PFE already has this issue...  is there a way 2 combat?

In SRPTs case, they addressed it in the trial and should have a clean set.  In the other cases, They whitewashed it or did not understand it and the data will be problematic.  Until PFE sheds some light on their program, it's hard to decipher if this is what's happening or issue.

As I mentioned elsewhere, each uD is different.  Mendell excluded X:<18&>058 due to possible interference with his design. PFE and SLDB for the same reasons could/should have different exclusion criteria.  1 theory into their issues at least.

So the demise of PFE was greatly exaggerated? Although SRPT remains in the forefront of DMD and definitely in GT.

Perhaps, but if you listen to Mendells talk to PPMD 1-2 years ago(11-16M), that was his logic to exclude 18-58; bcs those parts of D are in his uD design.  Following that logic, knowing the PFE/SLDB designs, they are not excluding the boys with a mutation in their design.  ??

I would agree and this is very concerning in general without knowing cause I wouldn't say its exclusive to $PFE!

One thing wondered about is could it be related to $PFE allowing all participants (I believe) and $SRPT allowing only those with mutations in the 18-58 range?

PFE does not use a minidystrophin! Minidystrophins refer to the Becker-like structures found in living patients and are much longer. MiniDs do not fit into AAV.  They called it that originally as a marketing tool and product of their own ignorance.

Many of us just think any BO offer would be too low. Going it alone would probably better maximize the value of the pipeline. 

But, hey, if $PFE wants to make a bid, they should do so. I just don‚Äôt think they have ever seen the value of $SRPT & will never make an acceptable bid.

That's not accurate about Hemo A.  $PFE $SGMO hit therapeutic range with cohort 3 in dose escalation > 12% factor.  Subsequently, FDA's new guidelines allow for accelerated approval in the 50-150% range, and $PFE $SGMO decided to move to next cohort #4, which is not the highest.

Javelin OS in overall population less mature, only 15% death/event at interim vs 18% in Keynote because Javelin powered for PD-L1+ for PFS/OS, interims based on events from PD-L1+ not overall population. That explains some of differences but not all - mature OS HR likely closer.

Just cause you can run scripts doesn't mean you have the reporting backend to go with it. That would require a custom solution as well, otherwise it is just all a black box. Makes troubleshooting interesting and difficult, especially if you can't just walk up to systems w/ issues

But, if the ‚Äúconcerning event‚Äù was simply lack of efficacy, why would $PFE add a 200e12 dose before moving to the 300e12 dose? 

This makes it more plausible that the ‚Äúconcerning event‚Äù was safety related.

Of course, that was implied in the original PFE post regarding the dose and schedule.  No reason to dose up (and not show biopsy data in Italy) if 1E14 was sufficient.  Remember, it‚Äôs hard to recruit patients, especially given $SRPT results.  Gotta put your best foot forward

Intriguing that Party B was not viewed by $ONCE as being able to handle the price of an acquisition so they were not pursued....yet they did offer $450m upfront for HemA plus addl economics to be worked out.
Another pharma company was approached who had no interest in HemA $PFE ?

I understand your LOVE to $SLDB & trying to defend them, that's OK.
But don't try to make them as better than $SRPT as you said "" Just wait until they have data from the higher dose.  People don't  realize yet their AAV likely makes the best protein (compared to $pfe & $srpt)

Prob bought by then.  Best value in biotech.  Just difficult commit at $20b. easier for $pfe to bump GTx r&d.  If no BO, I agree still digesting high price range.  don't let go at $200 b.c. will continue leg up like last. And spike again when they announce new (non DMD) develop!

Ok, I see your point, it‚Äôs a good point, actually. But, if patients are pre-screened why have $SLDB and presumably $PFE had immunogenicity problems in their GT trials? 

And, if $SRPT ‚Äòs GT makes it to market with much lower immunogenicity, then unsatisfied demand would be lower?

Good advice. 10 to 20 cons on stocks like  AMD ,  PFE, VZ, CSCO. ..pay a max of $10 comm.  Do this a couple of times a day, Earn $300-$500/ day. Don't want stress of dealing with SPX? This is a stress reducer. Also  can consider  weekly UVXY-as way to play SPY with time

Didn't say would go there just were asked if could dose higher and mentioned it.

Yeah its quite the risk (and cost) to escalate for both $PFE and $SLDB not to mention delay. Fortunately for $SRPT they've hit good efficacy and aren't dose escalating.

I think fade was those who accumulated in the 120s and those tired of the fade and grabbed a few % while they could.

I agree that PFE better suited. BIIB scares me. Their market cap is propped up on a conglomerate of failed or likely to fail drugs. Not a good home for SRPT

Less about finding the money than it is about coming to terms on a price.  Personally I'd still rather see $PFE make a run at $SRPT (with a stock/cash offer) than $BIIB.

Mfg is a huge undertaking.  My opinion is that they likely received 1 or 2 very low ball offers already.    But now with $biib on the hunt, $pfe no longer has the privilege of catch up or acquire.  BP's go in seriously this time.  Call me a speculator.  $srpt

Yes. PFE was considering an insomnia indication for pregabalin, years ago. I think they just wound up putting those measures into the other indications & claiming it helped with sleep if you had the condition it was indicated for, which is what those papers I linked to are about.

I also feel $pfe or other already offered too far from the mark.  The raise was well pre-planned b.c. they thought,data would give another huge pop. Wrong but carried through plan.  Plus acquirer valuing them multiple fronts, not just SP. Now bids COULD get serious $srpt

Weekly momentum indicators are at similar levels last seen at the end of Q1 2016. We remain very bullish on the market cycle but expect a temporary pause in Q2 characterized by more sector rotation.

Anything is possible, $pfe has a market cap of $232B. $pred at $300 per share is only $90B. Will it be worth $90B in the future?Who knows but I think $30B is very achievable. Time will tell but I think it‚Äôs much more that $2.30

If $PFE data is similar to $SRPT is that even enough considering a 50% higher dose = higher cost. I'd argue $SRPT still has the best construct in that case

PFE high dose is 3x, at 3E14

The dose response curve is potentially non-linear at the higher doses, therefore possibly higher expression levels.  We shall see.  They have a lot of ground to cover to catch up to $SRPT

Very rough calc and just $SRPT at this time. I think $PFE ~6 month+ behind. $SLDB maybe 1-2 years IMO.  Rough estimates with limited details.
At this stage and doses testing (and presuming broad labels) unless $PFE is planning > $SRPT capacity I think Demand will exceed supply

Unfortunately $PFE is more than 6mths behind. They are still dose finding at best. $PFE latest dose level will effect their ability to produce doses at a commercial scale.

only way they start pivotal in 1H‚Äô20 is if PFE goes straight to a pivotal trial. If they go straight to pivotal they will have to wait for pivotal to read out clinical outcomes. So enrollment time plus 1 year read out puts them with data in like 22 and approval late 22 or 23

Personally, I don't think it PFE will be better.  There has been discussion about dose escalation, which I don't believe would be necessary if there was good data at the low dose like SRPT had.  They might have safety, but nothing more.

General principle true, but this says nothing about what any individual BP may choose to do in m&a in case of DMD, besides pfe itself. And in this specific case, big pharma big marketing muscle isn't necessarily the winning/needed strategy for DMD sales.

~ the stimulus behind this conversation was in figuring out why $SRPT valuation has faltered from $150s.

~ people are blaming ""a poorly timed unneeded offering"" 

~ i disagree and think it was the $pfe deal terms. which shows BP will go in-house on this one.

I agree, I like the program in $PFE hands to better optimize protocol.

Given what is public anyway I'd give $SGMO better chance to be competitive than $ONCE/Roche.

$BMRN data actually much better in man than NHP models think mgm even surprised by that.

Overall good article but got key fact wrong. Rivals $PFE $BIIB didn‚Äôt follow $NVS into gene therapy, in fact they entered the space much earlier along with $GSK who already exited, late comers like $NVS Roche actually spent big to leap frog into commercial stage of gene therapy.

Ultimately it is the responsibility of all three - ASC, Heastie and Cuomo. But the Senate was publicly for and fought for PFE, whereas the Assembly were overt obstructionists - Heastie was known to be squashing it behind the scenes and in his public statements.

Heastie uses IEs as his excuse. Good policy means passing what is needed - PFE - and then continuing to do the work. Continue to work to get IEs out as well. To not pass PFE because you don't simultaneously get IEs out, so thus pass nothing, is poor leadership.

Can't really say I agree we're in a ""bio bear market"" when XBI is only down 13% from ATH while $SRPT is down 50% from ATH. I think $PFE data is certainly weighing on the stock as well as other things I'm not privy to by looking at the price action lately

I'm sorry Heastie decided to punt PFE into into a commission and do nothing instead of taking steps. He's keeping up the incumbency protection program. That is poor leadership. Is Heastie planning on having voices from the community on the commisision? Or just political favors?

Did PFE ever show low dose data? I only remember slides from a random presentation that said going to high dose and ""possibility"" of mid dose. I probably should remember since I think this is the biggest 2019 catalyst by far. I'll be rolling 2020s to 2022s on next bump up.

Now i know why $SRPT did not take Genethon off their pipeline list: https://sarepta.com/our-pipeline
Genethon will use (recombinant) rAAV2/8 i believe as the uD vector. It has many key differences (advantages?) over pfe/sldb AAV9. Very exciting imo

With our % of institutional ownership and other big hitters it shouldn't matter what the rest of the market thinks. If we're not up 20-40 when PFE fails, I'll be pissed. I've been wrong here many times before already so I'm expecting it.

IMO, $SRPT stock price is being weighed down due to the following:

1) Pending GT competitor data (PFE 1H19; SLDB 2H19)
2) Waning biotech bull market
3) Pending GT pricing resolution (biotech vs ICER & payers)
4) Pending Golo 8/19/19 approval
5) uD GT mid 2020 data readout

Except we know that SRPT GT does work.

Truth - I know we're bantering opinions, but I believe anything less than superior PFE data (which I believe to be unlikely) will serve to bolster our SP.  but who really knows?  Current action makes no sense.  It's just today's sentiment.

Interesting question ~48 min about why DMD GT not on slide of 15 approved by 2022. Answer ducked a bit (said could be as more data and emerging profile)... IMO not 2022 or data not (yet anyway) showing blockbuster potential.

Maybe some of the $SRPT SP price action is that $PFE intends to invest only a few billion to supplement their pipeline. Not exactly supporting a Sarepta bo. In any case, it's hard to say, visibility is poor.

Is their argument that it seems a stretch that $PFE would disclose such compelling data that it would warrant a jump from ph1 to ph3 and thereby catch up with $SRPT? Perhaps true - but in this space - it doesn't necessarily take that much to make such a jump.  We'll see.

If you compare the two uD programs, $Srpt is ahead of $PFE in time-to-market. $SRPT uD is safe, so $PFE won't have an edge there. That leaves efficacy, where $SRPT uD has produced up to 222% of normal. Does anyone really expect $PFE to top that?

to fit in AAV, in research papers where they tested different designs. So PFE's design is a microDystrophin, as is $SRPT and $SLDB, and choosing to name it with the term ""minidystrophin"" is very dishonest and inconsistent with the conventions of all the research behind it.

1 bit that was 'confirmed' as new is PFE is behind. 2022 (early or late??) expected if at all.  So while PFE talks about manufacturing readiness, relying on Bamboo colleagues, jump to phase 3, etc, $SRPT is dosing and moving towards 2021 (early) action.

That's exactly the way to interpret what PFE is signaling. Hope they will man up & change their mind, be transparent the same as $SRPT & $SLDB
I wish $PFE will work as well, even if it show a lower expression, they can be used to the 10-15% kids who will have immunity to AAVrh74

As DI noted, PFE GT is 300% higher dose.  So, even if can match the $SRPT 90% micro-D expression, that viral load is huge and portends high risk for AEs.  Seems like $SRPT safety profile, high expression, relatively low dose, large manufacturing capacity should prevail.

My $SRPT CC takeaway
-PFE viral titer 300% (not 150% because of assay technique)
-Can‚Äôt dose with other GTx products, so get it right until science advances (I was wrong)
-PPMO MAD starting at 4mpk (probably about the same as 40mpk PMO).  Would like to go a lot higher. Thanks DI.

The other option is/will be PPMO for some boys if $SRPT GT is not an option. So $PFE may be competing with $SRPT 's other pipelines with their inferior(not determined yet)  product.

Yes I've heard and many analysts have 10% COGS.  $SRPT COGS could be, say 200k per dose.  With PFE at 3X the VG, they could be at 600k/dose.  Granted I do not know their process, nor SRPTs yield, but imagine building inventory for an unknown demand at 600k/pt.

The fact that Mendell started at set dose and $sldb and $pfe did a dose finding is tacit admission that they were way behind $srpt . The question is can they eventually meet the bar for approval OR did they rush something to clinic that wasn‚Äôt ready ??

I see it as more than a COGS issue. They have to make a much bigger investment (gamble) than $SRPT to meet the fraction of demand they expect. So 3x $SRPT mfg even for $PFE that is a big demand in a short time.

It really depends on the method. Most of the time mass spec is not quantitative because of varying ionization efficiency for different peptides. Forgive me for not expecting PFE to have great capabilities with recombinant proteins and with analytical determinations with them.

I would not make any assumption that PFE will present bad GT DMD data in June.. it's possible, however no one knows. I never count my chickens.. ever. In short, I hope PFE has viable data but SRPT's is better. Lives are at stake, SRPT's in the lead - let the best drug win.

The facts are: (i) PFE is not legally obligated to show the WB data, (ii) According to PFE, WB is not particularly ""meaningful"" in predicting functional benefit -- so nothing unethical in their mind in not showing WB. FDA is irrelevant at this point of the game. $srpt

PFE suggests that they will shoot for approval based on functional data (i.e., full approval and not AA). Full approval doesn't require biomarker efficacy, though I'm sure it bolsters the case. $srpt

$SRPT I agree with PFE on WB for dystrophin but they can't argue that IHC is not essential in assessing fiber[+] quant. and localization. Mass spec. does not give us that data. PFE show us the IHC slides!!!

The facts are: (i) PFE is not legally obligated to show the WB data, (ii) According to PFE, WB is not particularly ""meaningful"" in predicting functional benefit -- so nothing unethical in their mind in not showing WB. FDA is irrelevant at this point of the game. $srpt

My belief on PFE data is weak efficacy on high dose as we have good evidence that low does didn't work.  May or may not have SAE's.

so it might work, but at high cost.  Leaves $SRPT in the GTx driver's seat.

My belief on PFE data is weak efficacy on high dose as we have good evidence that low does didn't work.  May or may not have SAE's.

so it might work, but at high cost.  Leaves $SRPT in the GTx driver's seat.

It'll be interesting to see the $PFE data since more similar to their program.  For $SLDB in particular safety as they both use AAV9. Why $SLDB is having so many problems is it dose/vector or something more specific to their program?  Since so secretive could be either (or both).

So $SRPT is at same dose but different serotype (rh74) so that makes it different at least, but $PFE does use same serotype as SLDB (AAV9), and has gone to even higher dose (3e14) and at MDA conference IIRC they told audience so far no sae's. Unless my memory is off.

In a nutshell, PFE not much different than SRPT construct according to him. Made me wince, but big difference is in the time lag for PFE behind SRPT. He thinks Mass Spec has advantages to WB but nobody is pointing out that FDA has not validated it in lieu of WB.

They ran western blots with FDA required protocols and showed low levels of D with Etep and follow on exon skippers. Of which FDA approved based on the increase from baseline. WB is the standard FDA set, SRPT released WB, IHC etc for their GTx, PFE not presenting WB would be BS.

PFE is just trying to get their foot in the door.  Let‚Äôs hope they end the obfuscation in a month.  I suspect their data will be better than SLDB but worse than SRPT.  They should be able to present some functional data if they‚Äôre confident in their program (age convolutes it).

$SRPT will broaden out the targets when the commercial scale is available, to include non ambs, older, younger, etc.  The quickest way to an approval is to sharpen the criteria and minimize variation.  Variation kills the functional p values.  PFE may not realize this soon enough

Either write covered calls or sell naked puts. It takes a lot of equity to sell puts but great way to play SRPT as it moves up. Look at the 6/28 puts with a strike of 125. Bid 10.25 ask 12.15.  If PFE disappoints, huge premium.

Yet something tells me even though 45/45/10 is most analyst models, typical $SRPT will go down 10+ if PFE has great & safe data, yet only up 2 if PFE isnt as good or safe. Also, if PFE subpar I don't know if they will even revise to say 80/10/10 until we show it in actual Q revs

The only info $PFE shared is going to the higher dose 3E14 (300% higher than $SRPT) in 3 patients, , according to a trial schematic presented around 2 month ago, they might reduced the dose to 2E14 in case of dose-limiting toxicity. 
While $SRPT have 2E14 with no AE or toxicity.

I see the $PFE strategy now. Use Western Blot to measure baselines. Use MS to measure post treatment.

Next they‚Äôll record baseline levels in the metric system and post-treatment data in the imperial system, and graph both sets of data on the same chart and tell us it‚Äôs the same.

COGS will very much be in play. PFE is at 3X dose, per DI, With what we know about COGS and dosing, $SRPT may well be able to price PFE out of the market; esp for older boys...if they get to market.

No one will be making a decision for gene therapy treatment with their pocket book. It‚Äôll be guided by first to market, safety, and efficacy. Not like price shopping MRI scans.

By virtue of capitalism $PFE will try to price match $SRPT as close as they can to have a chance.

It was Jeff Chamberlain& that's not what he said. Sellside w its inaccurate summaries again. He said he thinks it would be easier (which is not true based on method pfe described before, 1.5 days labor to produce MS sample), but wouldn't expect different result if MS works right

Kinda sad. Couple of the bumps and bruises didn‚Äôt need to happen. Still GTx trial is almost 100% enrolled so clock starts ticking soon. PFE may not be able to befuddle the market regarding their GTx data release soon and Golo will be approved soon. Light at the end of the tunnel?

B.c. there is a legitimate concern from other potential buyers - if PFE data so inferior, why arent they buying $srpt.   PFE must expect to be able to catch up eventually.   Or maybe $20B still too rich for anypne without significant baseline rev, at which point will be too late.

$srpt I think a valid point in this is if pfe had very disappointing data would they be releasing it at ppmd? Wouldn‚Äôt they be sneaking it out late on a Friday, I guess we‚Äôll know soon enough

No, They've not updated their TP with their apparent new $/GT yet.  I presume they will update it after PFE data release at PPMD.  I don't see how, if PFE is less than forthcoming, they won't have a massive upgrade, but we'll see.  The numbers are 165TP to 331TP on just $/GT.

PPMD is no joke, we should start a campaign and ask PPMD to put pressure on PFE to report meaningful data.  Considering the patients are locked in one type of GT, PFE should not play games with them and be honest and forthcoming with the results.

There's no other explanation PFE can give about hiding the WB data which they said they already have it, but might have no time to present it at PPMD!

PFE will choose mass-spec data so it's hard to compare with $SRPT data ...Apples-to-Oranges 
But the market will figure it out

PFE will not be disappointing (since yes, they are presenting at PPMD), but will likely be inferior to $SRPT (since they are likely shying away from presenting the WB data) .. but the end-result will be lack of complete data to compare the two (thats what PFE wants).

If PFE was willing to pay 20B, it already would've happened. Their presence in the field lkkely keeps others at an arms length. Problem is, if PFE gets sbeaky/shifty with data, other BP might be interested...but our PPS would rise and price might be closer to 25B. Very expensive.

Based on $PFE 2/16/19 Parent Project Onlus presentation (YouTube), Pfizer should have the following data for PPMD: Cohort 1 (1E14 vg/kg) 2 mo (participants 1,2,3) & 12 mo biopsies (participant 1 and maybe #2) and Cohort 2 (3E14 vg/kg) 2 mo biopsies (participants 4,5,6,7?,8?,9?)

Good point. $PFE at ~$2B in Ex-US as opposed to $AMGN which did more than 2x at ~$5B in US alone, reaching same conclusion. Different narrative had it been an Amgen document. No one's calling on them to foot the bill in those comments.

Short answer: ask your PFE.  (An internal thread at the same time, too much of a coincidence!) It has to do with how those devices send hardware inventory, ends up doing a full instead of delta, so that puts more load on MP and SQL.

1 year = bare minimum $PFE is behind. And they benefit from what Sarepta learned about needing commercial supply, and they technically have commercial facility, just not at scale.

$SRPT will do 3 trials before approval (1 commercial supply, 2 non-c). $PFE could potentially do 2.

My impression was they are pumping crispr for vertex, and to downplay srpt gene therapy, Nomura has done some bizarre notes on SRPT in the past pushing pfe-as-competiton narrative in ways that turned out false so dramatically  to the point of being peculiar.

$SRPT, this was PFE rat %D data from one of the analyst reports; lucky I even copied it down:
3 Months / 6 Months 1E14 to 3E14
biceps 78 to 75 / 85 to 85
diaphragm 40 to 40 / 55 to 65
heart 55 to 85 / 90 to 90
1) 3X dose had little impact
2) the 6M > 3M expression, assume > 2M

No one know for sure, PFE said they will present their mass-spec data, and if the time allow them they might show the WB & IHC that they have on hand as mentioned few weeks back at one of the analysts report (I think GUGGENHEIM)

Also, look at the PFE rat data from the pic floating around on this thread.  6M is the peak of that data (no further data point to see if later peak).  So where the peak is IDK, but it's not 3M nor 2M.  2M also serves to make comps difficult/confusing vs $SRPT & $SLDB

Exactly. $PFE come to market after $SRPT had already treated a large population. $PFE COGS would be higher, reducing margin compared to SRPT price as an anchor. And they haven‚Äôt made enough manufacturing investments so they‚Äôd be forced to used 3rd party commercial @ higher COGS.

PFE ph 1 study is open label, not randomized double blind placebo controlled, therefore, they had access to the data. The ph 1 study design calls for cohort 1 biopsy (2 mo.) & safety data to be reviewed by an External Data Monitoring Comm. (E-DMC) before cohort 2 could start .

My gut tells me the monster move in xbi Monday was on the back of the pfe arry news and srpt used that as a platform to break through 125 and force an early run up into ppmd.  I like the volume and continuation but think srpt mgmt has been exceptional about not having leaks.

Agree. $PFE wants to be considered a viable DMD GTx competitor without proving it or even providing the sort of data that the FDA is on record as wishing to see. And strangest of all ""the market"" is like ""oh wow"". Gimme a break. Its put up or shut up time. $SRPT data is out there

I'll be in 6/28s or 7/5s...prob 7/5.  Not nearly as confident as I was going into 6/19/18 and I sold 50 of my 250 calls at 100 the day before on 6/18/18 with cold feet being on margin. I would think if PFE sucks they would give data in PR and not present anywhere face to face.

I would be careful assuming any sort of functional decline for PFE would be seen as a positive for $SRPT. I can easily see people reading that through to $SRPT as a negative as well, fair or not. There are already durability concerns, justified or not

Likely only cohort that patients have been followed 12-month post treatment. $PFE PR for 1st patient dosed (22Mar2018) did say only present data once patients were followed for 12-month in 1H2019. They do enroll wider range age group, expect variability.

It's their own protocol where $PFE put WB & IHC as the primary way to quantify dystrophin the same way $SRPT did as well.
Choosing mass-spec is OK, but they can release all 3 results & compare apples to apples

I agree. They already agreed to the importance of WB and IHC. If you want to include MS too, go right ahead. Regardless of the PFE data, they are at least a year behind. Probably more when they must make trillions of capsids more than SRPT per patient dosed. That will not be easy

And to think of it, PFE was willing to shell out $160B for AGN in a merger back in 2015. So agree with Simon, even though at the moment it looks like ABBV paid a big premium to AGN Monday closing price, it's still way below where AGN was trading at it's peak.

$PFE has gene therapy data coming out Friday for a drug that competes with Sarepta and likely will be a catalyst (up or down) for the drug maker. Option flow has been fairly bullish for $SRPT though.

How about this: you mentioned in 2028, 7B in rev via 1 analyst.  2028! really an estimate for 9 years from now to say they are a bit risky for their 11B in MC.  How much was PMO (not GT) rev in 2028?  Throw some shade on $SRPT and not much ""critical thinking"" on PFE IMO.

$SRPT So say you; evidence??  6Qs in, GILD had 40% of the cumulative rev for Hep C treated.  So let's assume you are correct and let's assume the DMD rollout proceeds like Hep C.  That's a lot of revs that SRPT will have amassed and be wide open before PFE starts running.

No qualitative comments on WB? Even if $PFE does not want to share the data, the question is, was it higher or lower than MS? Was there a correlation between WB and MS?

$PFE following data might look better, but you are not counting the fact that despite the HUGE high dose 3E14 PFE still got lower expression that $SRPT
PFE had WB & didn't share it as it's too low
What next, decrease dose to 2E14 to reduce SAEs but will reduce expression as well.

Kenny, it is possible that if patients screen out of SRPT (AAVrh74) they may be ok for SLDB/PFE (AAV9). However, AAV9 has a much higher screen out and some could screen out for both, this is where PPMO will play a strong role.

Perhaps it's just too trusting of PFE rather than anything dishonest - What rationale do they give as to how monitoring would help this situation? Intervene sooner with soliris and steroids? That doesn't seem to have helped SLDB prevent SAE in their jump from 5e13 to 2e14 dose.

Yes, PFE was obfuscating about their poor results by stressing differences among normal individuals. Also, did not ""show any work"" wrt ms method. $SRPT bears do not really understand a thing about mass spec methods but will literally believe anything that fits their biases.

Agree. I don't know the LatAm nor Asia DMD numbers and have no clue the likely penetration, so I shy away from guessing those, but confident once approved, there will be rev from there as well.  With PFE/SLDB data and Zolgensma pricing; ALL models are a bit behind.

No, $PFE was mean absolute change of SALT from baseline - CF all over again - $ACRS directly comparable numbers for 3 doses only 11, 15, 18 respectively per slide presentation.

SALT data quite weak at 24-week compared to 2 JAKi from $PFE:

$ACRS <20% (range 12% to 18% from 3 doses) placebo adjusted mean absolute SALT improvement from baseline; 

vs 

$PFE 33.6% and 49.5% respectively at 24-week.

$BMRN patients are now waiting for $PFE $SGMO hemoA phase 3 trial to enroll. Seriously, if you were a Hemophilia A patient why would you ever rush into a phase 3 study with very high patient variability & durability/dose optimization issues when $SGMO showing impressive data?

Do any of you think the strategy change partly or mostly due pfe results? My personal thought is that was a key factor. Once the race had stopped due to Pfizer results, they had the ability to go with the best case strategy for approval without losing pole position

2026 Hem A revenues of $300M will be generated in 2021 latest. Surely $PFE will generate $2B in 2021 of which 15% will got to $SGMO.

Heres what we know; $SRPT 1 of 28 pts (4 in open-label)  with 1 hospital day for observation and PFE with 4 of 6 pts (6 in open-label) with ~13 hospital days and serious intervention and an internal hold.  SLDB I don't care to research but not great.

There is a big difference between $PFE having to halt their dosing of additional patients due to SAE's and $SRPT patient having a reaction that is common with DMD boys and did not result in a halt. Based on prelim data, SRPT has the best safety & efficiency of the three so far.

I agree but two points remain:
1) the 6 month clock starts after patient enrollment which will be much faster than originally thought.
2) The geographic overlap of $PFE and $BMRN = patient awareness and may support the precept that they may wait for comp.

Certainly not a good look can't find exact quote of SAE in hindsight the choice of words by CEO & CMO could've been a tell.  Two comments that stick out:

That is classic concerted efforts by the management, analysts AND the ""private investors"" who bought at 4s. All bullshits. $SLDB has inferior AAV vectors to $SRPT and $PFE (higher toxicity, lower efficacy), and much lagging behind, and the CEO is probably not an honest guy.

I love this! However, I see ""This is hard"" as part of growth mindset. To me, GM isn't centered on seeing things as easy, but on persevering and believing in self *when things are hard*

Soon we will know. $PFE moved SB-525 to phase 3 and with what they are privy too they took the decision to build a $500M manufacturing capabilities for gene therapy. If successful this platform will be replicated in multiple diseases. So wish them luck.

I think you'll see signs of efficacy but question is how strong, dose response curve, etc. $ALRN & $PFE have decided they want to ensure they have 35 pts in tumor types beyond liposarcoma. They could have left it at 25 pts.

In 2000 the PE of $PFE was around 50...
and interest rates were a lot higher in 2000.
Today forward PE $PFE around 12-14 , BMY today around PE of 12....  
To me 2000 market much more expensive than today, across the board.

Steroids do have negative side effects but have been shown to extend function in DMD. Which is why the vast majority of DMD patients are on a stable dose of steroids. All 3 gene therapy programs PFE, SLDB and Sareptas require stable dose as an inclusion criteria.

It is completely and absolutely nuts to give up on biosimilars. The argument that, for example, a trastuzumab biosimilar created by $PFE or $AMGN is not as good as Herceptin or somehow clinically different is ABSURD.

They escalate doses of steroids just prior to GTx and taper back down to SoC dose to avoid immune response over the course of 30-60 days. There was no compliment activation observed in their trial if you are looking for an answer. It did occur in Solid and PFE req use of Soliris.

For 5G exposure I'm looking more at KEYS and AMT, for dividends I'm looking at undervalued, high dividend payers in beaten down sectors like $VLO $PFE $WFC, stocks with little pressure on their divided sustainability. Although $VZ seems to be in pretty good shape there.

Well first you must define ""problems"" SLDB/PFE have two problems - tox AND expression. Sarepta has shown incredible expression consistently at lower doses than SLDB/PFE. Could tox show up for $SRPT? Sure, but each day that goes by, that risk diminishes. To date? Minimal SRPT tox

Think a 3 wheel lock, each wheel is independent of the others. PFE/SLDB have the first 2 wheels on the same setting, with a different third setting. SRPT has different setting on all 3. SRPT is the only 1 to show any meaningful data. PFE/SLDB have had major side effects.

Don't forget; Mendell, the one that used AAV9 for #Zolgensma and understood the IP issues, then went onto DMD and purposefully used AAVrh74 and says he believes it clear.  It should be obvious $PFE $SLBD must have an agreement for AAV9 use (including w Genethon); $SRPT not likely

Also Mendell knows full well AAV9 crosses blood brain barrier fairly effectively. Pretty certain he did not want that quality in his uD GTx. If so likely a very smart move vis-√†-vis pfe sldb

Seems likely that if the data presented at #ASH19 remains compelling, $PFE will trigger P3 which may coincide with event and announce their 2nd Hem target under agreement.  Also McDavid today mentioned they were looking forward to sharing ALS data.  Seems likely to be on Dec 7

Thats fair to both sides.  

That being said, the VRX price gouging model needs to be done away with, and thats a direct threat to alot of large caps who do it regularly (PFE, MRK, JNJ) just at 9%, who may need to adjust vs pleasing the financial crowd.

$pfe is hard - I used to trade it ALL the time - then it got demolished and I haven‚Äôt looked since

I think if the weekly could regain bottom kelt and daily holds middle - could have a chance of some upside

the challenge is that neither Doug or Barry will let this go for less than $185, and they prob. think it is worth much more.  Do you think $sny or $pfe would be willing to offer $185+ right now?  I hope so.

You make good points. Seems to represent an unusual barrage of anti Sarepta events. I doubt the BOD/DI are susceptible to such an approach. But Ya never know I guess. Still, no PFE shenanigans change the $185 line in the sand.

Funny because $PFE is one of many companies that has been cutting R&D in favor of prices increases. 

Over the last 30 years their in-house R&D has cost them about $100B which turned into net sales of $30B in organic rev. So most of their profits have come from M&A.

Must say I don‚Äôt understand $PFE continuing to pursue their DMD GTx offering. They are behind in every category one could be behind in, and yet wish to continue pouring dollars in regardless? Seems terribly wasteful. Drop the program and buy $SRPT or not. Why waste millions?

And that's only in case $PFE can go through the AAV9 toxicity issus, that might surface again when dosing a large number of patients.
$SRPT by YE19 would be dosed almost 24 DMD (20 non-placebo + first 4 kids) patinets & 3 LGMD pats+ 3 soon, and no SAE that cause a clinical hold.

You should be delusional to even write this sentence, it's not about $SRPT superiority, but how on earth you are even thinking that $PFE or $SLDB with so many SAEs & clinical trial halted by the FDA while $SRPT dosed over 20 kids with no SAEs & going forward.
Hope all 3 succeed.

I have no doubt that $sgmo and $pfe have a new large deal to announce following#ASH19. My assumption is R&D will feature tantalizing ‚Äúleftovers‚Äù that Pfizer chose not to pursue.

$PFE has invested heavily in area w/ M&A and build out of manufacturing.  My bet isthey want to buy $SGMO but no current interest so they will pursue owned indications to avoid another HemB situation, while maintaining open dialog with SGMO about M&A in future.  Just spitballin

PFE was one of the best gigs I've ever had. I was a transactional PFE. So I was in 1-3 enterprise, fortune 1000 environments a week. For 6 years. I should write about it sometime.

BTW I don't know if you visit IV board but they are quite likely calling this disappointing because someone posited $SGMO would sign a deal with $PFE to partner all of their gene therapy candidates by R&D day.  Nothing was ever said by company but fake news doesn't seem to matter

Consultants and PFEs are two sides of the same coin. Both technical delivery but consultants tend to be longer term and dedicated to projects while PFE are more transactional and have two main scopes Proactive (think onboarding accelerators) and Reactive (helping with CritSits)

Definitely. Cardiovascular isnt really GILD's space but they are collaborating with NVO (Novo Nordisk) on NASH. NVO does have eyes on the diabetes/cvd arena.  https://novonordisk.com/patients/diabetes-care/type-2/type-2-diabetes-and-cardiovascular-risk.html‚Ä¶

That said, if there ever is a B/O, Amgen and PFE are probably front runners. Maybe NVS.

FWIW I agree with his assessment so far. It also seems $PFE is going to partner with many small bios on gene therapy by using its manufacturing advantage.

That is the other risk.  You can be right on the thesis and all it takes is one strategic buyer to be wrong.  $PFE buying Anacor.  $AGN buying $MAPP.  Could name a lot.

Agreed AAV9 was optimized for CNS not neuromuscular. It is a very real issue as both pfe and sldb etc can attest to. Good news is srpt and Genethon not using aav9

Fewer deals during election year so it makes sense more deals this year. For mega mergers, I think it was more likely due to price weakness than anything else. Last time mega mergers like $MRK - Schering Plough, $PFE - Wyeth in 2009 financial crisis if exclude inversion attempts.

""increase yield, purity, and characterization of the product""....on this, Sarepta and PFE are in agreement, hence Ingram's decision to focus on those issues and delay his primary G Tx programs an additional 6 months. That said, regardless of how pure PFE's GTx is, it's still AAV9

Granted small n's... $SGMO higher mean/median, more @ normal even vs the P1/2. We don't know that $SGMO/$PFE will have a similar decline when they go to P3 as $BMRN did.

I agree the big elephant in the room is durability. MAYBE $QURE right and theirs will win LT?

Not sure there is AA opportunity timeline wise. It took valrox 2-yr from dosing trial start to AA filing, similar timeline would get 2022 AA filing by $PFE, problem is by then valrox could get full approval already based on valrox full data in early 2021 and filing subsequently.

Alternatively, should $SGMO SB-525 follow a similar decay kinetics as Valrox, our analysis points to a 13+ yr durability, which would be nearly 2x expected from Valrox.  And they didn't even mention safety which appears much, much better than $BMRN.

$SGMO...   in terms of year end, who knows.  200 day and 200 week avgs sitting about 10.40 and with HemeA moving to phase 3 with PFE, a good story next week results in quite a move... Tuesday should be fun, Next week, not this past one , of course. People cured. Very cool.

Stock prices look at fwd earnings. Yes. It's the bear thesis for the price. Blockbuster status and very likely acquisition is the bull thesis. The swath of people and scope of use is just scratching the surface.  Sale will be north of $75 imo $amrn
$pfe is my guess too.

$AMRN Must execute a strategy to grow sales over the next few years in order to have it stock appreciate.  Eventually, it may grow into a $40 stock? That being said PFE could use this drug to replace Lipitor & buy it for $40 tomorrow. They have a proven strategy for sales growth.

It‚Äôs amazing to me that Microsoft still has job postings that are Redmond only.  Like, we own Teams.

There‚Äôs no better sign, today, of healthy culture than a team that‚Äôs strongly remote. To be successful, you have to constantly be inclusive. That muscle memory is killer.

Interesting idea. I would note that patients treated by PFE also had platelet declines and there is some belief that high doses of AAV9 are causing this. 
It could b interesting in terms of ITP and platelet mechanism to study high dose AAV9 in animals, impact on platelet pathways

ironically, IMO,  $SRPT is probably most vulnerable to a #takeover right NOW!  Before the Roche deal closes.  if I was $PFE, $MRK, or anyone with global scale; I would step in, now that #sarepta has shown the cards and share holders are frustrated - $225 takes the prize?

Based on $PFE DMD GT preliminary data, I don't see them being competitive, regardless of manufacturing capacity. $SRPT DMD GT delivers higher expression, has a better safety profile, has a lower screen out rate and utilizes a significantly lower dosage.

Hope you‚Äôre okay PFE,

At least once a week I look around me & wonder if I‚Äôm dead. 
When I do - I think I‚Äôm in heaven.

But it‚Äôs not always been that way - I know what it feels like to wonder if I‚Äôm in hell or purgatory ... to feel trapped with no escape.

The company is ridiculously undervalued. Prefer $AMRN to GIA than wasting time entertaining lowball offers. Mgmt should quickly grow Amarin into a BP and the thought that AMRN could turn into a BP may scare the sector as there's ample data that says Amarin can grow into a $PFE.
