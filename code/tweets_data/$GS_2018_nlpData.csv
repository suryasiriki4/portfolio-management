He finds cost of capital advantages and shamelessly exploits them. (“I’ll ‘invest’ in you, $GS but I want call options. With a yield!”). 

Same formula for 60yrs. Lack of shame is a huge part of it now. His rep scales the adv even beyond the cash. Brilliant but not an aphorism.

I like $WFC right here with a tight stop. Banks seem a little strange. $GS and $JPM had been basing better these last 7 trading days comp to $BAC, but $JPM broke.  $WFC just had the gap up, unlike the others. Not in them though, they seem a little off ever since the stess tests.

In other words $TSLA signing on with $GS can only be bearish (ie. restructuring?) and there is 0 change of it being bullish (ie. advising on private deal financials etc.) That's the only way that that you can say categorically being added to restricted list is bearish.

$GS ‘s “strader” strategy has yet to be appreciated by investors, down 8% on the year and only trading at its pre-financial crisis high from 2007. $JPM was first U.S. bank stock to breakout above 2007 highs and has since gone parabolic.

The forthcoming 1MDB book by @TomWrightAsia @bradleyhope is a superb page-turner. It also is awful news for Goldman Sachs, which comes across — at best — as an enabler of a multibillion-dollar fraud.

This Mychal Kendricks complaint is jaw-dropping. Government spells out how he literally - literally...not figuratively - turned $80,000 in a brokerage account into $1,200,000 in less than five months. And he basically paid $10k in kickbacks to do it. Gordon Gekko was less brash.

The irony of $GS advising $tsla on taking the company private at $420. Then when the deal falls through, they put a sell rating on it at $210. Why advise $tsla of going private at $420? Forget $tsla short sellers......Goldman is the new short

Let’s assume that the future will prove it right. What do you think a majority of funds is doing *now? Exiting? Dumping? Logically they should be scared when seeing this chart from $GS . The reality is that nobody is selling. Is your fund mostly in cash? I bet *not.

Seems reasonable assuming that quality issues, suspected production interruptions and mystery lots are an exception and not widely spread. I take $GS analysis as the positive case. Stock can of course be irrationally high but the general prediction seems right.

There is no scenario in the world that can unfold from the current situation that is not good for GOLD:

1-Fed slows interest rates trajectory. 
Or
2-Market continues to crush.

Best RELIABLE gold play with leverage to price: $ABX ,in my view.

Anyone with a brain, let alone the smart bosses of Goldman Sachs, would know that a fee of $600 million on a bond of $6.5 billion (almost 10%) was fishy when such fees are a fraction of that amount in a bond issue. But they closed their eyes & pocketed those fat profits. Scandal!

$GS - they are at 2016 levels now and I am 110% convinced they will find new and extremely profitable ways to make more money off their clients and markets  almost impossible to properly value though, but will be the last bank standing in any kind of total economic collapse.

$GS banksters come in two flavors: 1) deals & 2) political. Despite pretension of political savvy, the firm is largely tone deaf when it come to matters of political economy. Fact that #mnuch really thought his stunt would be helpful says it all...

Or the decline is Federal Reserve caused and only marginally due to Mr. Trump. 

Fed raised rates 4 times this year and is rolling off $50 Billion/month of assets. $GS note says $600 billion is about 100 basis points equivalent to fed funds rate.
