$MCD has been testing this since Jan 2018 (planning back into ‘17). Dunkins Pres is an ex-McD person so I can only assume he caught whiff of this at our test restaurants and rolled it our first.

Pls indulge me where I would be in violation?

It’s all historic info from Q1’18, all public and written about. I just put the story together for you. Stated nothing about any type of sales info from non-reported periods (Q4’18). 

Perhaps this just goes against your short $MCD?

It’s all historic info from Q1’18, all public and written about. I just put the story together for you. Stated nothing about any type of sales info from non-reported periods (Q4’18).

There was Burger King, McDonalds, Wendy's and Dominos.  No sign of Chik-Fil-A, Krispy Kreme or Chipotle.

Not $20 but $MCD prices are already way up past couple years, 10%-20% inflation rate as starting pay is up to $12/yr. Dividends are earned. Agree w/u tho, 2many buybacks. Mixed bag. Change is needed though.

From a burger side QSR it’s sometimes opposite of your example. Doesn’t matter where a $MCD is built, competitors will just follow you. As soon as we build, they typically come. Wendy’s admitted this strategy in the 90’s. Their development dept was McDonalds.

Last year it hit $180, which means the stock has incr’ed 27,000% since 1978 (far more than the 937% incr in CEO pay)

Boeing as a zombie. Debt to equity extremely high. They have $10.6B in debt but only paid $475M interest. But that interest payment was up 70% YoY. Will they get another 70% interest rise next year? Can they handle another 70% rise in interest next year? Something to watch. $BA

At $18B cap market values each chipotle restaurant at $8.45M. Each $MCD location is $3.97M, each $SBUX location is $3.05M.
I personally like all of them, $CMG starts Europe expansion, but hard to imagine that each their location to be twice as valuable as a $MCD restaurant.

Completely. That’s the kind of stuff that feels like they could have taken out a few iterations. The screens are more accurate for special orders already but getting a Diet Coke is like doing a Jumble in hell. $MCD

$MCD is still a work in progress. The screens should be great. Makes custom order accuracy realistic, speeds along operations in theory. No one thinks about checking in at a kiosk for flights anymore. 

But, wow, customers don't want to use them. Yet. MCD will figure it out.

No, I’m sure Steve will elaborate on the call next week abt other delivery economics. 

As for Uber, I mean they aren’t perfect but they have done a pretty good job. I don’t see another delivery partner being that much better. But I do see another vendor as a good addition.

$MCD same store sales increased 2.5% last year, while guest counts declined 2.2%... so McDonald's also had a major price increase last year... 

(some of the difference can be other factors, of course, but in 1-yr time frame majority is usually price)

Good info

A 5.3% increase is about what a $McD would do in about 2 yrs of time. We had a lot of menu mix shift into more premium products (fresh beef) which led to higher checks

5.3% is insane, especially at one time (and at an average ticket of probably twice that of a McD’s).

...$MCD’s 210,000 company employees are hardly at risk if a $15 minimum wage went into effect (no one is discussing your $50/hour rate, which is ridiculous).  In addition, $MCD could reduce its royalty rates to help its franchisees, but that’s doubtful. But would “make sense”.

I looked at how Burger King plans to improve its breakfast sales. 

McDonald’s does 2x BK’s AUV. But it does 4x BK’s morning unit volumes. And then it has twice as many stores so basically McDonald’s does eight times as much breakfast biz as BK.

$McD has decreased service times YOY & has a lot more opportunity in this aspect. I won’t give out the propriety calculation between +SSS for every second decrease in service times but it is quite eye opening. It’s all about speed!

$mcd and $dri are the greatest restaurant stocks. Sadly I've only owned the former for 10 years almost not the latter. Still if you don't marvel at the operations and marketing of both you're not paying attention.

You're looking at it from a different perspective. We can both be right. If I put 75% of my portfolio in a S&P index fund and 25% in $MO, $XOM and $MCD I would've outperformed the market over time. I view indexing as a hedge against risk, you see it as logical inconsistency.

Wendy's @Wendys where is my $1 I was ripped off of the last time I visited your restaurant? I was just reminded of it when I picked up my  daughter and I asked her if she wanted to grab something to eat on the way home. She asked if we could get Wendy's. No! They ripped me off!

True for many companies, but the issue isn't CEO vs worker pay. 

If you confiscated the pay of $MCD CEO and redistributed it to all the workers they would end up with about $15 extra - not going to change a thing...

The real issue is PROFITS GOING TO WORKERS or WALL ST.

My initial reaction was if $MCD didn't move the needle then who cares about Carl's JR

However this atleast appears to be a wide roll-out, vs just a test run

That reminds me when the Telcos in Europe made crazy acquisitions then investors worried about balance sheet and pensions. Or FT articles in 2007.
For a scary example of FCF vs buyback and debt, look at $MCD McDonald's. Something like 3bn+ debt every year.

A look at the $MCD $BYND burger test in . 

Interesting price point of $6.49, only a 30 cent premium to a Quarter Pounder. My assumption is that you lose $$ on every QPC to PLT purchase if not incremental.  

Early take is that it is surprisingly good for faux meat, looks great

$MCD should decide in the next 4-6 weeks.  I don't really have a target price for that short of period.  I would suggest selling when it rallies above $82 and trying to buy below $70 or switch to another stock.

Depends what you mean by “these stocks”. If you’re referring to Utilities & REITs, I’d bet their share prices would struggle. Not sure if you read the actual dividend articles in this IBD yet or not, but they reference stocks like $MSFT $MCD $JNJ & $V, which could still excel.

Does it need one? I think it does, given its coffee/breakfast sales.

I’m frustrated w/ $mcd - it’s never gonna go lol

It’s just in a rising channel that looks like a really long bear flag

Think it just keeps grinding higher - buy the panic dips maybe? Not gonna be a quick mover personally

Would love to see it $230 - w/new ceo it may take longer
