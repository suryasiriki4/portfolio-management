Good point, but would you say it's different for asset managers. They would generally have longer investment periods if I'm not mistaken.

$XOM is down 5% YTD on this oil crater move and it's at the 52 week low so that is huge under-performance relative to the market. If oil collapses back to low $50's I'd say there could be some value there in addition to the dividend.

$XOM is in major cost cutting moves right now, flights/hotels/cars, continued shift of older employee to contract, major cost cutting of XTO unit with all accounting getting moved to Argentina (huge labor discount). IMO shows where industry is going. Agree $CVX fee ops better

I have been in the red with $XOM for some time and have been wanting to lower my cost basis. My issue is that they are covering their dividend by taking on more debt. Which I would be ok with if I felt like oil prices were trending upwards. So thus far I have remained patient.

I‚Äôm watching Telus $T, $XOM, $UPS, and $MMM. I should really be focused on consumer staples, but they are all too expensive. It‚Äôs hard to find a high yield (>4%) quality dividend growth stock even with this correction. Anything I‚Äôm missing?

Fair enough and maybe I read too much into your initial tweet.

It just sounded like you were in ""shaming"" $XOM or $BP or other O&G companies because they saw sustainability as a profit source rather than out of a ""true"" sense of responsibility.

I apologize if I misinterpreted.

$XOM is good, but I'm researching today. Looking at $VET (which just cut div by 50% & stated they have solid plans for operation under a Covid emergency). Also watching $VLO because it's a fuels play, so may benefit more quickly if consumers come back but oil stays low.

Dividend is an important focus for $XOM & they've been adding debt to increase the div payout last few years. I assume they'll maintain it for a while to give oil a chance to rebound. Not my expertise, but I'd guess 12 months out at $40  oil probably OK, but at <$35 I'd be wary.

Senate R bill:

1. One-time payment up to $1,200 per adult. 

2. Won't get this unless income reaches $23,500. 

3. So 64 million households with incomes below $50,000 would get less than $1,200.

4. These are same Rs who gave wealthy and corps $2,000,000,000,000 in tax cuts.

Even with the price of oil really struggling, $XOM has an incredible portfolio of productive assets & has shown a willingness for acquisitions. It's also selling at < 5X cash flow.

As always, I reserve the right to be entirely wrong. But I feel pretty good about this one.

Just to be clear, I have no investments here and that's unlikely to change. But when there's no sign of hope in the near future and people are just bailing on stuff like $XOM that they were comfortable owning at 2x - 3x current levels, there's probably some LT opportunities.

I certainly agree, and 5+ yrs is how I like to invest.

$XOM would hate to cut its dividend, as institutional funds depend on it. But I agree it's likely, since there's a lot of LTD coming due this year.

Those payments take priority. But I'd love to see a huge buyback as well.

What is next in the #oil market? Here are my expectations:

- OPEC+ will finalize & approve the cut tonight with or without #Mexico.  This will have a limited impact on the market in the short run

- Aramco will announce an OSP that reflects the production cut. Very bullish.

I own $CVX which I think is a stronger company than $XOM, and $VZ - again feel it's better positioned than $T.

But I had my eye on all four.  Just went with the plays I felt more likely to profit.

I own both!

$T is a slow grower which I‚Äôm not so excited about and can‚Äôt see a world where they grow faster either.

$XOM is probably a value buy at the moment. Also facing long term headwinds, but probably still safe.

I‚Äôve had my eye on $T and $XOM

Why I like them? Well they
-Can be bought relatively low compared to 52 week low
-Have high but realistic yields

$T Has 5G and HBO Go money coming

$XOM has a dividend payment coming up soon and real world implications point to a strong rebound

When I look at potential trades, I think about the kinds of trades that will seem obvious in hindsight.

One day we will look back at XOM with a 10% dividend yield and say, what the hell was I thinking?

I think for me personally and the way I invest it‚Äôs $MMM without a doubt. I think it‚Äôs a case of risk and reward. $XOM has a much higher upside I think but the potential downside doesn‚Äôt sit well with me at all. $MMM should be a nice long term hold.

$XOM has the higher upside from this levels but more downside as well.

Dividend cut could still happen and demand for oil will be lower down the line.

$MMM is the safer pick.

I had $XOM for about 10 years and i am negative about 40% on that holding. It seems that everytime i buy it goes down to new levels.

Hard to avg down when a purchase here and there is just a drop in the bucket.

I picked $Xom because I know we need oil and gas but apparently picking a company like $tsla is the winner. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with my entire net worth sitting in a company that can tank on a single tweet saying the stock price is too expensive.

The journey has started. At least for a few of them trying to diversify to renewables. Issue is profitability of those vs O&G . $CVX, $XOM are the ones that seem to be staying the course in trying to reduce the unit cost within O&G.

On the riskier side, I‚Äôm long on energy stocks like $ET, $NGL, or oil $XOM $CVX but the future is murkier

Dividend payout % are changing everyday though, so always be careful and do your research

$XOM daily chart.  Similar to $CVX and if it can get above $47.5ish, could have room to dance its way to the 200-day at $58ish.  Don't trade these too often and mostly they just slug along.  If willing to slug along, could be a trade in there somewhere if $SPY keeps recovering.

And your point of moving to new businesses, I think you're opening yourself up to a LOT of survivorship bias there. If you made Mark Leonard CEO of $XOM I'm not buying it. He could do well but I'm not going to bet on it.

Have you given any consideration to preferred cumulative stocks trading under par?  $PFFA will get you there nicely.

Btw it was really good, love to hear a special detailing $OXY and how it will either survive or not coming out of this mess.
The info on $CVX and $XOM on the fiscal control was great.

Alger Management is pushing fake data to hype a BUBBLE.

Top five market cap in 2000 were $MSFT $GE $CSCO $XOM and $WMT

Zero chance their free cash flow (however defined) was just 2% of $SPY. Or only 11% of market cap.

Here is a useful chart.

Interesting because it doesn‚Äôt feel that way anymore. Big cap tech is dominating and driving all the gains in the indexes. 

I wonder if the rise and fall of $GE $IBM $XOM and others that used to lead the S&P are the reason why the market cap weighted index underperformed?

Agreed. Too many stocks to think about; better to find your sweet spot and stick with it. I‚Äôll never be a value stock picker. I have no interest in $IBM $BAC $GE $XOM $PG etc. Those are not just boring companies but a waste of time to think about. I like the HIGH growth STOCKS.

Now those are some names with quite the track record! Those first 3 are all in similar positions. Beaten down dividend giants that will rise again. $O has to maneuver the pandemic with its exposure to theaters. $T has been stuck in a rut from poor acquisition. $XOM saw oil fall.

What you do with the cash is not relevant for this study. You could sell $AMZN in 2015 to buy $NFLX, or you could sell $XOM to buy $NFLX. You would be much better off by doing the latter than the former although on the surface your decision to buy NFLX 5 years back looks great.

Here's a great short thread on 'Dividend Aristocrats'
Jack Kimber
@jackkimber
 ¬∑ 2 Jul 2020
Investors love Dividend Aristocrats.

Why?

A Dividend Aristocrat is a company that reliably pays out and increases its dividend year on year. 

The minimum amount of time before a company can reach the aristocrat title is 25 straight years of payouts.

Good info, value/income oriented investors should take a look at $PFE which has an attractive valuation. $CVX also is a good buy for income investors looking for yield due to its solid financial footing. I would stay away from $WBA &  oil and gas industry name $XOM, high risks.

$MSFT looks to me to have highest likely ROI over the long term. $AAPL will grow but likely slower imo but still always a good bet. $T great dividends but not much growth opportunity. $XOM could recover strong and gain maybe 30% but long term could struggle.

Over the last 6 years $XOM have paid ~ $20 B more in dividends than their FCF. The good years have been just ok, the bad years have been terrible. The debt is still low which can keep the dividend raises a few more years. Never jumped in due to this.

I do understand and the payout ratio is extremely high. But do we have anything in this world to replace oil? No. So obviously the world needs the oil in many years to come.

I have $XOM too and at a 15% loss so far and I am happy collecting dividends since it's spare money and there's nothing safe out there. Oil is not going anywhere. I consider dividend stocks to be like rental properties that churn pa$$ively. Doesn't mean that I only invest in them

$XOM has not suffered nearly enough for an energy C-suite to start understanding 6th-grade math. Probably will have to cut it next year as they bleed out for the rest of 2020. But they will only do the smart thing out of absolute desperation.

For $XOM at least 6 years on FCF. But debt is low, so they may have some room  + asset disposals (tough at this point)

Replying to @javyandrade, @dividendsNdrip and @Dividend_Dollar
Over the last 6 years $XOM have paid ~ $20 B more in dividends than their FCF. The good years have been just ok, the bad years have been terrible. The debt is still low which can keep the dividend raises a few more years. Never jumped in due to this.

This is a difficult chart. I like the H&S possibility, because it replicates what I see on $XOM, but the volume on the right shoulder looks a bit strong. I will give this one some more thought. Interestingly, on a long-term view, we might have a falling broadening pattern.

$RDS.B and $BP both look to be focusing more on renewables now and cut their dividends.  $XOM and $CVX continue to march ahead as planned, but Exxon's recent news about stopping employee 401k match means they're trying to do everything possible to avoid a cut.

Over the last 6 years $XOM have paid ~ $20 B more in dividends than their FCF. The good years have been just ok, the bad years have been terrible. The debt is still low which can keep the dividend raises a few more years. Never jumped in due to this.

Depends on how you define ""logical"". Their logic is that by decreasing cost of debt, better access to capital, companies will have more cash to keep from laying off workers. Meanwhile $XOM is laying off workers so it can maintain its dividend.

Shouldn't dividend investors be wary of such a high payout?

$XOM doesn‚Äôt have me worried because I plan to hold well past any troubles they will have. Plus i‚Äôve heard some oil industry workers reassure me the markets will rebound after the covid mess clears up. Covid may just present a buy opportunity.

I saw some $XOM on dark pool on Friday actually. 2.3m move. Probably some big move to happen this week. Current price $41 is still considered neutral territory. Above 42.50 expect more upside. Below 39 mayhaps call it quits lol

It depends how diversified you want your portfolio to be.

You can dumb all your cash into a high-yield stock like $T or $XOM

Or a bunch of different solid businesses with varying dividend yields

Smaller average yield, but safer.

45% of this ETF is $XOM $CVX. It's probably the only ETF more lopsided than $QQQ $XLK are with the FAANGs.

If you MUST play this sector just buy the two majors & collect the 9% divvies. September seasonality is bad on this ETF but firms up a little Oct-Dec so maybe wait til EOM.

You have to figure that those with the best balance sheets survive and takeover good assets cheap either from M&A or mergers.  Is $CVX the safest play on an oil rebound followed by $XOM?  Or pipeline companies like $KMI that just collect a toll as oil is moved?  Any opinions?

About $XOM, of course they offer a nice yield. But with a very high payout ratio. And on top of that I am not convinced that oil is future-proof. Don't you think buying $XOM shares is a bit risky for long term secure dividends?

Thanks so much for the mention! I think you're right to get rid of the $XOM option too. And the US election just got even more crazy with the death of #RBG. One could be forgiven for just wanting to sit out 2020 altogether!

A small cut is absolutely necessary if $WTI does not increase soon. However, the div cut may be priced into $XOM already. Uncertainty around the cut is at least part of the low price now.

No, honestly, shorting anything that is down 55% YTD is beating a dead horse.

For the reference, Doc and I selling puts on $WFC.

I know it's a cliche phrase but ""they are too big to fail"" at these levels.

Same principle applies to $F, $XOM.

$XOM have always been a fast follower, rarely developing new technology first (like $RDS with deepwater, LNG or independents with unconv).  That's their prerogative.  But when something is proven, they dive in.  Could be that way with renewable.  Not everyone needs to lead.

Might be a bottom in energy, not so sure about $XOM they can't afford that dividend - Even before the pandemic, Exxon couldn‚Äôt cover its dividend payments, paying out $14.7 billion in 2019 while making just $5.4 billion in free cash flow

Options Traders Are Pricing In an Exxon Dividend Cut, Analyst Says
Whether Exxon can maintain its dividend is one of the most active debates right now among energy investors. The company has a strong incentive to keep making payments at current levels.

I see $XOM slashing there dividend.  Go with $CVX. Much better balance sheet, much less debt, much safer dividend.

$XOM ... will depend on how quickly clean energy progresses and how forcefully Exxon leans into it. True of all the traditional energy players, but (correctly or not) we usually hold out Exxon as a premier capital allocator.

It is not official.

Dividend is not sustainable without borrowing, cutting more Cap-EX or without an oil recovery.

Other majors like BP and Shell already cut their dividend. 

I expect XOM to do the same.

if you are person 1: Dont sell your shares if $XOM drops to $35, Buy the dip the company will eventually go up.

put in another 5k at $35, you now own 232 shares at an average cost of $42 and will receive $807 per year

Always buy the dip!

Great interview. Good to see someone recommend Exxon Mobil.

$XOM suffered because it got conned by #ESG to buy up natural gas assets, which under performed even pre-Covid.

And adjusting for dividends, isn't under-performing integrated.

Dividend history can change fast mate, recently happened to $RDS.B and might as well happen to $XOM. 

The point is, at some point when picking 300 companies, some of them will cut their dividends especially the Europeans. 

You still need the allocation.

No way its $cvx with $nbl deal in the works and a re-org. $xom is the only major that makes sense to me. $bp getting out and $rds a slave to #esg. $tot not a real super major imho

I would say only $CVX or $XOM as European majors are busy elsewhere. $CVX in better shape.

It‚Äôs a cyclical stock. It's not the end of Oil, we will continue using it for many more decades before renewable energy makes a serious impact. $XOM is in a good position to ride this crisis. It's a matter of time before it rebounds.

$CVX is much easier to justify than $XOM right here. Until $XOM gets to rationalizing their dividend policy, they are just burning enterprise value and stock price. $CVX cash burn is dramatically lower and will be stronger with more options in a rebound.

$XOM had a (31%) revenue decline YOY to $135B.

They haven't released their full financial disclosure on 10-Q's - will have to wait for that

Nice divy but Q3 ER was: cost reductions & potential earnings in Guyana/Permian in '21

$XOM will make it, there is massive under investment in oil supply + upcoming fracking ban. They are the only ones investing on new supply and in foreign land. The reports on oil death are an exaggeration. Even the official branch of the globalists (IMF) predicts 110 mbd in 2040

I'm not giving advice.
If I'm wrong once every decade that works with me.

I can't wait to see $VET trading at $60 and $PEY at $35 any time soon.

Keeping those stocks for all those years was bad advice. 

But hey! We'll see how $XOM vs $MSFT go in the next 18 months.

$XOM revenues are down more than 50% from what they were in 2012. So their ""underlying business"" is not seeing sustained growth. That's a requirement for the dow index, so $XOM got kicked out. I'm not seeing any reasonable arguments for why they shouldnt kick it out.Just punditry

The timing on those $XOM and $MRO charts by the call buyers looks pretty good historically. I thought back in spring we were seeing a generational low in Energy, but my sector signal reversed. It's such a volatile sector, but maybe we're going to see a W pattern here.

Yeah the whole Permian strategy by $XOM was a debacle. Started in 2017 died 2020. Terrible. But that's the past. BUT the same mgt that brought you that strategy are currently having another swing. So far the jury is out. All dividend all day now.

XOM‚Äôs OCF last year at ~$64 Brent was 38% lower than in 2005 at ~$54. That degradation is present in prior years too + reflects investments made for different outlook. A big problem with much higher capex-dividend obligations. $XOM has outspent OCF by $28b since start 2019.

You might want to look at $XOP instead of $XLE which I think has a weighting of 43% is $XOM & $CVX.      The $XLE might be ""safer"" though, which is why most non-energy investors like it over the $XOP.    Just a thought.

I don‚Äôt argue your thesis long, long term, but buying $XOM now in the low 40s, in my opinion is a good value play. It‚Äôs the long-term buyers like me who were buying significantly higher 3-5 years ago, who are in a tougher spot.

I wouldn't criticise $XOM's operations.  Certainly, they are in a tough business.  But selling the back fifty to fund the dividend at what they describe as ""below cycle trough conditions"" is questionable.

But this reminds me of the $XOM call.  When asked which projects they would pursue or divest, they noted that JV partner alignment was a consideration.  Call it an exogenous factor.  Another firm has another WACC and different assumptions, expectations, or strategic direction.

Basically made 2500% return on $XOM puts in march.

Took that 500K and rode $BTC from 4.2K to 9K.

Took that 1 mil+ and went long Tech in late April.

Not opining on whether they're good investments, but you can avoid wash-sale issues by buying similar stocks - maybe $VLO or $PSX for $MPC and maybe $CVX or $XOM for $COP. Not perfect substitutes, but you only have to hold them 30 days, then can trade back. Or consider ETF $XLE.

This will never happen, for a host of reasons, not the least of which is $XOM shareholders don't want to toss money down a rathole chasing 8% ROI green projects.
