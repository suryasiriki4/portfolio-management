Here's the thing: if you have cash, now is a good time to buy some blue chips on sale. The ones you want to hold for years, like $BRK.B, or $DIS, or $PG, or $MMM, or even $UNH. But the real sale is yet to come in my opinion. It's always good to have at least 10-20% cash reserves.

You bet... I take advantage and buyvwhen I can. Drops always recover nicely.... you can also flip to recover.... IMO a merger or buyout may be in play... You never lose if you don't sell..... Too much volume.... One good move can put $NVCN over .20 easy.

Old labels fail to describe the players that are shaping the health-care industry
