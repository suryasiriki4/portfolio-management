Chicken is what‚Äôs for dinner, if you hadn‚Äôt heard, and apparently members of the McDonald‚Äôs National Owners Association are fed up... many are lamenting the current state of chicken at the chain, as they watch their customers head to competitors. https://washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/01/14/mcdonalds-franchisees-want-that-new-chicken-sandwich-and-they-want-it-now/‚Ä¶

$BYND was announced a few weeks ago as a test, I think.  That being said (although I am long $MCD @ $147.42, it should be a REIT) and I *know* 
@BrandonVanZee
 disagrees.  Basically, $MCD acts like a REIT in every sense.  Well, except for 2 ""sign-ups.""  SEC & IRS. Time will tell.

Essentially I believe you are saying you don't want $MCD to be a REIT - even though that's how it acts in reality/realty - due to 90% NI rule and future possible dividend cuts, is that correct?

Despite the order size being double for delivery vs in-restaurant, $MCD only counts it as 1 transaction.

So as delivery grows as a share of business, the declining traffic numbers probably aren't reflective of the actual number of people eating at $MCD, correct??

Yes.  Look at $AMZN $APPL $NFLX over 1st ten years (amazing runs) and then the 2nd ten years, amazing runs again.

Then look back 30-40 years at stocks like $HD $MCD $JNJ $COST etc.

The best keep going up, over decades.

Those who do not invest now fear a great economic collapse.
There will be a lot of volatility on the market in the upcoming months, but great businesses will not cease to exist. 
Strong dividend growers will continue to be a great investment.

My favorite part of $CMG earnings (other than the digital sales pump job) was the disclosure that in the last week of March SSS dropped 35%

Assuming SSS rebounded to a $MCD leading level of -22% for April... that SHOULD still be a problem for a stock trading w/ a 50x multiple.

Agree.  Look at tobacco deal making or deal making.  Where there is no growth, people turn to debt fuelled deals.  $KO a few big questionable deals.  $MCD is ok as a franchise business and I think has seen top line growth. Most consumer staples run with net debt to juice returns.

Personally, this seems like a good strategy from $MCD they have hurt from this virus, but are still able to operate. They probably feel like they are discounted too low, as of now, and see an opportunity for the future.

Agreed, raises the question of push vs pull.  For the well-positioned, I think a lot of adds are coming ~""for free."" 

V impressed $MCD E(Q2 SSS) is just -13% (though probably less about adds, more about repeats). Much harder for store-heavy co's to do this than digital-only.

It‚Äôs actually pretty good. They reformatted years back after getting their ass kicked by $SBUX. $MCD discovered ‚Äòthrow:‚Äô coffee to water ratio. Game changer. And improved their beans. Only problem is $MCD still use the hot plates as warmers. Should be thermoses. #ShipsCoffeeShops

I have been involved in QSR/ Burger King before.
There‚Äôs a huge pressure on the franchisee front. Many will likely have solvency issues.
The asset-life model of $MCD & $QSR is great. Very likely these strong brands like $CMG & $SBUX emerge stronger after this.

To summarize McDonald's earnings call: Things are terrible. They'll be terrible for a while. They're more terrible at breakfast. They're not as terrible in the U.S. because of drive-thrus and will be less terrible for $MCD coming out of the crisis because it's familiar and cheap.

Yes, the curfew did close some $McD but it sounds worse than what it actually was in my experience. If a curfew was set at 10 PM, a non-24 hour restaurant closed 1 hour early. That last hour is typically one of the slowest hours all day.

I like your analyze of $Sbux. Interesting that they are able to pay the dividends amid Corona and lock down on several countries as $Mcd does. 

From my point of view the big chains will profit from the lock down as many small #restaurants will not survive.

$WMT and $MCD two giants in the game.

It will be interesting to see how they perform in the years to come.

And what new markets they try to make revenue from.

Usually this means a large amount of depreciated or amortized assets.

In $MCD's case they own a lot of real estate which is likely above book value.

I'm not a huge fan of $MCD personally. It's a stagnating business with a scary free cash flow payout ratio.

Totally. I usually side with local fast food joints when I am looking for something. Burgerville (here in the beautiful PNW) is my favorite. I think the last time I was at a $MCD was perhaps 10 years ago?

It‚Äôs also a way to increase profitability, I‚Äôd rather give away a McDouble for $1 on the app (where you can only buy 1) instead of letting you buy 5 at one time.

$MCD is finally starting to push the app (mobile order & pay) via advertising. 

Many markets have switched their deep discounting into app offers. For example, instead of doing $1 McDouble in-store they will put in on the app.

If you added a QSR with 2-3x location growth potential, would have chosen that.

Is Howard Schultz the founder of $SBUX?

Was Ray Croc the founder of $MCD?

In both cases, no

Same here, it seems I am getting the hang of trading stocks after 7 years in Bitcoin and 2-3 years in stocks now.

But I always suggest to be safe. I put most of my portfolio in dividend paying stocks ($KO $MCD) to balance higher risk with other stocks like $BB Payoff is balanced

You are right; there are some exceptions.
$MCD changed its business model which forced a revenue decline.
A similar situation happen a few years ago with $MSFT. Before the cloud, the company also reduced its revenue potential by switching its software suite into subscription.

This is the issue I take with $MCD. I know they changed the biz model but revenues lower than 10 years ago. Stock price is heading back toward ATH. I guess there are always exceptions but for $MCD owners hope revenues start to grow again at some point.

This is generally true, but there are plenty of exceptions too. 

The marginal cost of say, Coca Cola $KO syrup, for each new customer is pretty darn close. 

McDonald's $MCD, running on a franchise model, also came w/ very high margins.

Plenty more too.

If it doesn't hold that low,  it could go all the way to 35 before some consolidation. Idk how $MCD have kept their stock going with buybacks and decreasing revenue but $INTC has mostly failed with Rev+.  I guess people want innovation from tech, don't care about food innovation.

Here is the $MCD example I used awhile ago. They were buying back stock in years when their FCF Yield was LOWER than their Interest Expense Yield. Need that sweet sweet EPS growth though when organic growth is going nowhere...

When the stock you are buying back starts to have a FCF yield that is lower than the interest on the debt, that is potentially problematic as you are levering up for no good reason (Well expect to boost EPS while sales are slowing...duh). $MCD

Buffett owned $MCD back in the 90s. Some say he saw similar opportunity he found in Coke...heavy competition in the U.S. but tremendous opportunity outside the U.S. Not sure why he changed his mind but I bet he regrets it.  I remember when $MCD was trading at $12 back then.

Yes, and Panera expects the coffee drink to purchase another product when they show up, even if unlimited coffee is a loss leader.

I was joking about the $MCD burger and fries. But it would be fun if they tried it.

McDonald‚Äôs does pretty well in a free market but also in aggregate likely decreases life expectancy/increases healthcare costs. Supports value capture by other regulated industries (health insurance, hospitals, life insurance, etc.)

Sorry for the delayed response. Yes, I still like $BYND...the explanation that people hoarded in the prior quarter made sense. Distribution still growing. And as for $MCD, it‚Äôs murky whether they‚Äôre supplying McPlant (I‚Äôd guess yes)...if so, that‚Äôll be good news if  it‚Äôs a hit.

I think $MCD has made it more than clear that they will never put another company's ""food"" brand on its menu!  Why is this even a topic? Who cares if they become a supplier to MCD.  MCD makes a living extracting a pound of flesh from its suppliers (and franchisee apparently)!

Yes, I noticed this yesterday. A lot of the bigger retailers getting hammered. I'm going to ask Jeff Macke what he things about this. $MCD has a similar setup also. And, check the $NKE 1/15 150 Calls. Unusual activity.

Or how much does Bezos own in $AMZN. Pretty centralized in my opinion, but their companies are great. ($TSLA is overvalued but the company is good imo)

Look at more of the older companies. $KO or $MCD, and their CEO's respective ownership of the company. MUCH MUCH less. Better?
